PKEFACE 

The first five chapters of this book give an 
account of my early education, previous to going 
to America, where it was continued, first at 
Monson Academy, in Monson, Massachusetts, 
and later, at Yale College. 

The sixth chapter begins with my reentrance 
into the Chinese world, after an absence of eight 
years. Would it not be strange, if an Occidental 
education, continually exemplified by an Occi- 
dental civilization, had not wrought upon an 
Oriental such a metamorphosis in his inward 
nature as to make him feel and act as though he 
were a being coming from a different world, 
when he confronted one so diametrically dif- 
ferent? This was precisely my case, and yet 
neither my patriotism nor the love of my fellow- 
countrymen had been weakened. On the con- 
trary, they had increased in strength from 
sympathy. Hence, the succeeding chapters of 
my book will be found to be devoted to the work- 
ing out of my educational scheme, as an expres- 
sion of my undying love for China, and as the

most feasible method to my mind, of reformation 
and regeneration for her. 

With the sudden ending of the Educational 
Commission, and the recall of the one hundred 
and twenty students who formed the vanguard 
of the pioneers of modern education in China, 
my educational work was brought to a close. 

Of the survivors of these students of 1872, a 
few by dint of hard, persistent industry, have at 
last come forth to stand in the front ranks of 
the leading statesmen of China, and it is through 
them that the original Chinese Educational 
Commission has been revived, though in a mod- 
ified form, so that now, Chinese students are seen 
flocking to America and Europe from even the 
distant shores of Sinim for a scientific education.

MY LIFE IN CHINA AND 
AMERICA 

CHAPTER I 
BOYHOOD 

I was born on the 17th of November, 1828, in 
the village of Nam Ping (South Screen) which 
is about four miles southwest of the Portuguese 
Colony of Macao, and is situated on Pedro 
Island lying west of Macao, from which it is 
separated by a channel of half a mile wide. 

I was one of a family of four children. A 
brother was the eldest, a sister came next, I was 
the third, and another brother was the fourth 
and the youngest of the group. I am the only 
survivor of them all. 

As early as 1834, an English lady, Mrs. 
Gutzlaff, wife of the Rev. Charles Gutzlaff, a 
missionary to China, came to Macao and, under 
the auspices of the Ladies' Association in 
London for the promotion of female education 
in India and the East, immediately took up the 

1 



2 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

work of her mission by starting a girls' school 
for Chinese girls, which was soon followed by the 
opening of a school for boys also. 

Mrs. GutzlafFs comprador or factotum hap- 
pened to come from the village I did and was, in 
fact, my father's friend and neighbor. It was 
through him that iny parents heard about Mrs. 
GutzlafFs school and it was doubtless through 
his influence and means that my father got me 
admitted into the school. It has always been a 
mystery to me why my parents should take it 
into their heads to put me into a foreign school, 
instead of a regular orthodox Confucian school, 
where my brother much older than myself was 
placed. Most assuredly such a step would have 
been more in play with Chinese public sentiment, 
taste, and the wants of the country at large, than 
to allow me to attend an English school ; more- 
over, a Chinese cult is the only avenue in 
China that leads to political preferment, influ- 
ence, power and wealth. I can only account for 
the departure thus taken on the theory that as 
foreign intercourse with China was just begin- 
ning to grow, my parents, anticipating that it 
might soon assume the proportions of a tidal 
wave, thought it worth while to take time by the 
forelock and put one of their sons to learning 



BOYHOOD 3 

English that he might become one of the advanced 
interpreters and have a more advantageous posi- 
tion from which to make his way into the business 
and diplomatic world. This I take to be the 
chief aim that influenced my parents to put 
me into Mrs. GutzlafFs Mission School. As to 
what other results or sequences it has eventually 
brought about in my subsequent life, they were 
entirely left to Him who has control of all our 
devising and planning, as they are governed by 
a complete system of divine laws of antecedents 
and consequents, or of cause and effect. 

In 1835, when I was barely seven years of age, 
my father took me to Macao. Upon reaching 
the school, I was brought before Mrs. Gutzlaff. 
She was the first English lady I had ever seen. 
On my untutored and unsophisticated mind she 
made a deep impression. If my memory serves 
me right, she was somewhat tall and well-built. 
She had prominent features which were strong 
and assertive; her eyes were of clear blue lustre, 
somewhat deep set. She had thin lips, supported 
by a square chin, both indicative of firmness 
and authority. She had flaxen hair and eyebrows 
somewhat heavy. Her features taken collectively 
indicated great determination and will power. 

As she came forward to welcome me in her 



4 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

long and full flowing white dress (the interview 
took place in the summer), surmounted by two 
large globe sleeves which were fashionable at 
the time and which lent her an exaggerated 
appearance, I remember most vividly I was no 
less puzzled than stunned. I actually trembled 
all over with fear at her imposing proportions 
having never in my life seen such a peculiar 
and odd fashion. I clung to my father in fear. 
Her kindly expression and sympathetic smiles 
found little appreciative response at the outset, 
as I stood half dazed at her personality and my 
new environment. For really, a new world had 
dawned on me. After a time, when my home- 
sickness was over and the novelty of my sur- 
roundings began gradually to wear away, she 
completely won me over through her kindness 
and sympathy. I began to look upon her more 
like a mother. She seemed to take a special 
interest in me; I suppose, because I was young 
and helpless, and away from my parents, besides 
being the youngest pupil in the school. She kept 
me among her girl pupils and did not allow me 
to mingle with what few boys there were at the 
time. 

There is one escapade that I can never 
forget! It happened during the first year in 



BOYHOOD 5 

the school, and was an attempt on my part to 
run away. I was shut up in the third story of 
the house, which had a wide open terrace on the 
top, the only place where the girls and myself 
played and found recreation. We were not 
allowed to go out of doors to play in the streets. 
The boy pupils had their quarters on the ground 
floor and had full liberty to go out for exercise. 
I used to envy them their freedom and smuggled 
down stairs to mingle with them in their sports 
after school hours. I felt ill at ease to be shut 
up with the girls all alone way up in the third 
story. I wanted to see something of the outside 
world. I occasionally stole down stairs and 
ventured out to the wharves around which were 
clustered a number of small ferry boats which 
had a peculiar fascination to my young fancy. 
To gain my freedom, I planned to run away. 
The girls were all much older than I was, and 
a few sympathized with me in my wild scheme; 
doubtless, from the same restlessness of being 
too closely cooped up. I told them of my plan. 
Six of the older ones fell in with me in the idea. 
I was to slip out of the house alone, go down to 
the wharf and engage a covered boat to take us 
all in. 
The next morning after our morning meal, 



6 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and while Mrs. Gutzlaff was off taking her 
breakfast, we stole out unbeknown to any one 
and crowded into the boat and started off in hot 
haste for the opposite shore of Pedro Island. I 
was to take the whole party to my home and 
from there the girls were to disperse to their 
respective villages. We were half way across 
the channel when, to my great consternation, I 
saw a boat chasing us, making fast time and 
gaining on us all the while. No promise of addi- 
tional pay was of any avail, because our two oars 
against their four made it impossible for us to 
win out; so our boatmen gave up the race 
at the waving of handkerchiefs in the other 
boat and the whole party was captured. Then 
came the punishment. We were marched 
through the whole school and placed in a row, 
standing on a long narrow school table placed 
at one end of the school room facing all the 
pupils in front of us. I was placed in the center 
of the row, with a tall foolscap mounted on my 
head, having three girls on the right and three 
on the left. I had pinned on my breast a large 
square placard bearing the inscription, "Head 
of the Runaways; 9 ' there we stood for a whole 
hour till school was dismissed. I never felt so 
humiliated in my life as I did when I was under- 



BOYHOOD 7 

going that ordeal. I felt completely crestfallen. 
Some of the mischievous fellows would extract a 
little fun out of this display by taking furtive 
glances and making wry faces at us. Mrs, 
Gutzlaff, in order to aggravate our punishment, 
had ordered ginger snaps and oranges to be dis- 
tributed among the other pupils right before us. 

Mrs. Gutzlaff's school, started in September, 
1835, was originally for girls only. Pending 
the organization and opening of the so-called 
"Morrison Education Society School," in the 
interval between 1835 and 1839, a department 
for boys was temporarily incorporated into her 
school, and part of the subscription fund belong- 
ing to the M. E. S. School was devoted to the 
maintenance of this one. 

'This accounts for my entrance into Mrs. 
Gutzlaff's School, as one of only two boys first 
admitted. Her school being thus enlarged and 
modified temporarily, Mrs. Gutzlaff's two nieces 
the Misses Parkes, sisters to Mr. Harry 
Parkes who was afterwards knighted, by reason 
of the conspicuous part he played in the second 
Opium War, in 1864, of which he was in fact 
the originator came out to China as assistants 
in the school. I was fortunately placed under 
their instruction for a short time. 



8 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Afterwards the boys' school tinder Mrs. 
Gutzlaff and her two nieces, the Misses Parkes, 
was broken up; that event parted our ways in 
life in divergent directions. Mrs. Gutzlaff went 
over to the United States with three blind girls, 
Laura, Lucy and Jessie, The Misses Parkes 
were married to missionaries, one to Dr. William 
Lockhart, a medical missionary; the other to a 
Rev. Mr. MacClatchy, also a missionary. They 
labored long in China, under the auspices of the 
London Missionary Society. The three blind 
girls whom Mrs. Gutzlaff took with her were 
taught by me to read on raised letters till they 
could read from the Bible and Pilgrim's 
Progress. 

On my return to my home village I resumed 
my Chinese studies. 

In the fall of 1840, while the Opium War was 
still going on, my father died, leaving four 
children on my mother's hands without means of 
support. 

Fortunately, three of us were old enough to 
lend a helping hand. My brother was engaged 
in fishing, my sister helped in housework, and I 
took to hawking candy through my own village 
and the neighboring one. I took hold of the busi- 
ness in good earnest, rising at three o'clock every 



BOYHOOD 9 

morning, and I did not come home until six 
o'clock in the evening. My daily earnings netted 
twenty-five cents, which I turned over to iny 
mother, and with the help given by my brother, 
who was the main stay of the family, we man- 
aged to keep the wolf away from our door. I 
was engaged in hawking candy for about five 
months, and when winter was over, when no 
candy was made, I changed my occupation and 
went into the rice fields to glean rice after the 
reapers. My sister usually accompanied me in 
such excursions. But unlike Ruth of old, I had 
no Boaz to help me out when I was short in my 
gleaning. But my knowledge of English came 
to my rescue. My sister told the head reaper 
that I could speak, read and write English. 
This awakened the curiosity of the reaper. He 
beckoned me to him and asked me whether I 
wouldn't talk some "Red Hair Men" talk to 
him. He said he never heard of such talk in his 
life. I felt bashful and diffident at first, but my 
sister encouraged me and said "the reaper may 
give you a large bundle of rice sheaf to take 
home." This was said as a kind of prompter. 
The reaper was shrewd enough to take it up, and 
told me that if I would talk, he would give me a 
bundle heavier than I could carry. So I began 



10 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and repeated the alphabet to him. All the reap- 
ers as well as the gleaners stood in vacant silence, 
with mouths wide open, grinning with evident 
delight. A few minutes after my maiden speech 
was delivered in the paddy field with water and 
mud almost knee deep, I was rewarded with 
several sheaves, and I had to hurry away in order 
to get two other boys to carry what my sister 
and I could not lug. Thus I came home loaded 
with joy and sheaves of golden rice to my 
mother, little dreaming that my smattering 
knowledge of English would serve me such a 
turn so early in my career. I was then about 
twelve years old. Even Ruth with her six 
measures of corn did not fare any better than I 
did. 

Soon after the gleaning days, all too few, were 
over, a neighbor of mine who was a printer in 
the printing office of a Roman Catholic priest 
happened to be home from Macao on a vacation. 
He spoke to my mother about the priest wanting 
to hire a boy in his office who knew enough 
English to read the numerals correctly, so as to 
be able to fold and prepare the papers for the 
binders. My mother said I could do the work. 
So I was introduced to the priest and a bargain 
was struck. I returned home to report myself, 



BOYHOOD II 

and a few days later I was in Macao and entered 
upon my duty as a folder on a salary of $4.50 
a month. My board and lodging came to $1.50 
the balance of $3.00 was punctually sent to 
my mother every month. I did not get rich 
quickly in this employment, for I had been there 
but four months when a call for me to quit work 
came from a quarter I least expected. It had 
more the sound of heaven in it. It came from a 
Dr. Benjamin Hobson, a medical missionary 
in Macao whose hospital was not more than a 
mile from the printer's office. He sent word 
that he wanted to see me; that he had been hunt- 
ing for me for months. I knew Dr. Hobson well, 
for I saw him a number of times at Mrs. Gutz- 
laffs. So I called on him. At the outset, I 
thought he was going to take me in to make a 
doctor of me, but no, he said he had a promise to 
fulfill. Mrs. Gutzlaff's last message to him, 
before she embarked for America with the three 
blind girls, was to be sure to find out where I 
was and to put me into the Morrison Education 
Society School as soon as it was opened for 
pupils. 

"This is what I wanted to see you for," said 
Dr. Hobson. "Before you leave your employ- 
ment and after you get the consent of your 



12 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

mother to let you go to the Morrison School, I 
would like to have you come to the hospital and 
stay with me for a short time so that I may 
become better acquainted with you, before I take 
you to the Morrison School, which is already 
opened for pupils, and introduce you to the 
teacher." 

At the end of the interview, I went home to 
see my mother who, after some reluctance, gave 
her consent. I returned to Macao, bade fare- 
well to the priest who, though reticent and 
reserved, not having said a word to me during 
all the four months I was in his employ, yet did 
not find fault with me in my work. I went over 
to the hospital. Dr. Hobson immediately set 
me to work with the mortar and pestle, prepar- 
ing materials for ointments and pills. I used to 
carry a tray and accompany him in his rounds 
to visit the patients, in the benevolent work of 
alleviating their pains and sufferings. I was 
with him about a couple of months in the hos- 
pital work, at the end of which time he took me 
one day and introduced me to the Rev. Samuel 
Robins Brown, the teacher of the Morrison 
Education Society School. 



CHAPTER II 

SCHOOL DAYS 

The Morrison School was opened on the 1st 
of November, 1839, under the charge of the Rev. 
S. R. Brown who, with his wife, Mrs. Brown, 
landed at Macao on the 19th of February, 1839. 
Brown, who was afterwards made a D.D., was 
a graduate of Yale of the class of 1832. From 
his antecedents, he was eminently fitted to 
pioneer the first English school in China. I 
entered the school in 1841. I found that five 
other boys had entered ahead of me by one year. 
They were all studying primary arithmetic, 
geography, and reading. I had the start of them 
only in reading and pronouncing English well. 
We studied English in the forenoon, and 
Chinese in the afternoon. The names of the five 
boys were: 1. Wong Shing; 2. Li Kan; 3. Chow 
Wan; 4 Tong Chik; 5. Wong Foon. I 
made the sixth one and was the youngest of 
all. We formed the first class of the school, and 
became Brown's oldest pupils throughout, from 
first to last, till he left China in December, 1846, 
on account of poor health. Half of our original 

13 



14 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

number accompanied him to this country, on his 
return. 

The Morrison Education Society School came 
about in this way: Not long after the death of 
Dr. Robert Morrison, which occurred on the 1st 
of August, 1834, a circular was issued among 
the foreign residents on the 26th of January, 
1835, calling for the formation of an Associa- 
tion to be named the "Morrison Education 
Society " Its object was to "improve and pro- 
mote English education in China by schools and 
other means." It was called "Morrison" to 
commemorate the labors and works of that dis- 
tinguished man who was sent out by the London 
Missionary Society as the first missionary to 
China in 1807. He crossed the Atlantic from 
London to New York where he embarked for 
China in the sailing vessel "Trident" on the 31st 
of January, 1807. He tried to land in Macao, 
but the jealousy of the Jesuits thwarted his 
purpose. He was obliged to go up to Canton. 
Finally, on account of the unsettled relations 
between the Chinese government and the foreign 
merchants there, he repaired to Malacca, and 
made that place the basis of his labors. He was 
the author of the first Anglo- Chinese dictionary, 
of three quarto volumes. He translated the 



SCHOOL DAYS 15 

Bible into Chinese; Leang Afah was his first 
Chinese convert and trained by him to preach. 
Leang afterwards became a powerful preacher. 
The importance and bearing of his dictionary 
and the translation of the Bible into Chinese, on 
subsequent missionary work in China, were 
fundamental and paramount. The preaching of 
his convert, Leang Afah, likewise contributed 
in no small degree towards opening up a new era 
in the religious life of China. His memory, 
therefore, is worthy of being kept alive by the 
establishment of a school named after him. 
Indeed, a university ought to have been perma- 
nently founded for that purpose instead of a 
school, whose existence was solely dependent 
upon the precarious and ephemeral subscriptions 
of transient foreign merchants in China. 

At the close of the Opium War in 1840, and 
after the Island of Hong Kong had been ceded 
to the British government, the Morrison school 
was removed to Hong Kong in 1842. The site 
chosen for it was on the top of a hill about six 
hundred feet above the level of the sea. The hill 
is situated on the eastern end of Victoria Colony 
and was called "Morrison Hill" after the name 
of the school. It commands a fine view of the 
harbor, as that stretches from east to west. The 



16 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

harbor alone made Hong Kong the most coveted 
concession in Southern China. It is spacious 
and deep enough to hold the Navy of Great 
Britain, and it is that distinguishing feature and 
its strategic location that have made it what it is. 

On the 12th of March, 1845, Mr. Wm. 
Allen Macy arrived in Hong Kong as an assist- 
ant teacher in the school. His arrival was 
timely, because the school, since its removal from 
Macao to Hong Kong, had been much enlarged. 
Three more classes of new pupils had been 
formed and the total number of pupils all told 
was more than forty. This was more than one 
man could manage. The assistant teacher was 
much needed. Brown continued his work in the 
school till the fall of 1846. Macy had a whole 
year in which to be broken into the work. 

Between Brown and Macy there was a 
marked difference in temperament and charac- 
ter. Brown, on the one hand, showed evidences 
of a self-made man. He was cool in tempera- 
ment, versatile in the adaptation of means to 
ends, gentlemanly and agreeable, and somewhat 
optimistic. He found no difficulty in endearing 
himself to his pupils, because he sympathized 
with them in their efforts to master their studies, 
and entered heart and soul into his work. He 



SCHOOL DAYS 17 

had an innate faculty of making things clear to 
the pupils and conveying to them his under- 
standing of a subject without circumlocution, 
and with great directness and facility. This was 
owing in a great measure to his experience as a 
pedagogue, hefore coming out to China, and 
even hefore he entered college. He knew how to 
manage boys, because he knew boys' nature well, 
whether Chinese, Japanese or American. He 
impressed his pupils as being a fine teacher and 
one eminently fitted from inborn tact and tem- 
perament to be a successful school master, as he 
proved himself to be in his subsequent career in 
Auburn, 1ST. Y,, and in Japan. 

Macy, the assistant teacher, was likewise a 
Yale man. He had never taught school before 
in his life, and had no occasion to do so. He 
possessed no previous experience to guide him 
in his new work of pedagogy in China. He was 
evidently well brought up and was a man of 
sensitive nature, and of fine moral sensibilities, 
a soul full of earnestness and lofty ideals. 

After the Morrison School was broken up in 
1850, he returned to this country with his mother 
and took up theology in the Yale Theological 
Seminary. In 1854, he went back to China as 
a missionary under the American Board. I had 



18 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

graduated from Yale College then and was 
returning to China with him. We were the only 
passengers in that long, wearisome and most try- 
ing passage of 154 days from Sandy Hook to 
Hong Kong. 

Brown left China in the winter of 1846. Four 
months before he left, he one day sprang a sur- 
prise upon the whole school. He told of his 
contemplated return to America on account of 
his health and the health of his family. Before 
closing his remarks by telling us of his deep 
interest in the school, he said he would like to 
take a few of his old pupils home with him to 
finish their education in the United States, and 
that those who wished to accompany him would 
signify it by rising. This announcement, together 
with his decision to return to America, cast a 
deep gloom over the whole school. A dead 
silence came over all of us. And then for several 
days afterwards the burden of our conversation 
was about Brown's leaving the school for good. 
The only cheerful ones among us were those who 
had decided to accompany him home. These 
were Wong Shing, Wong Foon and myself. 
When he requested those who wished to accom- 
pany him to the States to signify it by rising, I 
was the first one on my feet. Wong Foon was 



SCHOOL DAYS 19 

the second, followed by Wong Shing. But 
before regarding our cases as permanently 
settled, we were told to go home and ask 
the consent of our respective parents. My 
mother gave her consent with great reluctance, 
but after my earnest persuasion she yielded, 
though not without tears and sorrow. "I consoled 
her with the fact that she had two more sons 
besides myself, and a daughter to look after her 
comfort. Besides, she was going to have a 
daughter-in-law to take care of her, as my elder 
brother was engaged to be married. 

It may not be out of place to say that if it had 
depended on our own resources, we never could 
have come to America to finish our education, 
for we were all poor. Doubtless Brown must 
have had the project well discussed among the 
trustees of the school months before he broached 
the subject to his pupils. 

It was also through his influence that due pro- 
vision was made for the support of our parents 
for at least two years, during our absence in 
America. Our patrons who bore all our ex- 
penses did not intend that we should stay in this 
country longer than two years. They treated 
us nobly. They did a great work for us. Among 
those who bore a conspicuous part in defraying 



20 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

our expenses while in America, besides providing 
for the support of our aged parents, I can recall 
the names of Andrew Shortrede, proprietor and 
editor of the "Hong Kong China Mail" (he was 
a Scotchman, an old bachelor, and a noble and 
handsome specimen of humanity), A. A. 
Ritchie, an American merchant, and A. A. 
Campbell, another Scotchman. There were 
others unknown to me. The Olyphant Sons, 
David, Talbot and Robert, three brothers, lead- 
ing merchants of New York, gave us a free 
passage from Hong Kong to New York in their 
sailing vessel, the "Huntress," which brought 
a cargo of tea at the same time. Though late in 
the day for me to mention the names of these 
benefactors who from pure motives of Christian 
philanthropy aided me in my education, yet 
it may be a source of satisfaction to their 
descendants, if there are any living in different 
parts of the world, to know that their sires took 
a prominent part in the education of the three 
Chinese youths, Wong Shing, Wong Foon 
and myself. 



CHAPTER III 

JOURNEY TO AMERICA AND FIRST 
EXPERIENCES THERE 

Being thus generously provided for, we em- 
barked at Whompoa on the 4th of January, 
1847, in the good ship "Huntress" under 
Captain Gillespie. As stated above, she be- 
longed to the Olyphant Brothers and was loaded 
with a full cargo of tea. We had the northeast 
trade wind in our favor, which blew strong and 
steady all the way from Whompoa to St. 
Helena. There was no accident of any kind, ex- 
cepting a gale as we doubled the Cape of Good 
Hope. The tops of the masts and ends of the 
yards were tipped with balls of electricity. The 
strong wind was howling and whistling behind 
us like a host of invisible Furies. The night 
was pitch dark and the electric balls dancing 
on the tips of the yards and tops of the masts, 
back and forth and from side to side like so many 
infernal lanterns in the black night, presented a 
spectacle never to be forgotten by me. I realized 
no danger, although the ship pitched and 



22 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

groaned, but enjoyed the wild and weird scene 
hugely. After the Cape was doubled, our vessel 
ploughed through the comparatively smooth 
waters of the Atlantic until we reached the 
Island of St. Helena where we were obliged to 
stop for fresh water and provisions. Most 
sailing vessels that were bound from the East 
for the Atlantic board were accustomed to make 
St. Helena their stopping place, St. Helena, as 
viewed from the shipboard, presented an outward 
appearance of a barren volcanic rock, as though 
freshly emerged from the baptism of fire and 
brimstone. Not a blade of grass could be seen 
on its burnt and charred surface. We landed at 
Jamestown, which is a small village in the valley 
of the Island. In this valley there was rich and 
Beautiful vegetation. We found among the 
sparse inhabitants a few Chinese who were 
brought there by the East India Company's 
ships. They were middle-aged people, and had 
their families there. While there, we went over 
to Longwood where was Napoleon's empty 
tomb. A large weeping willow hung and swept 
over it. We cut a few twigs, and kept them alive 
till we reached this country and they were 
brought to Auburn, N. Y., by Mr. Brown, who 
planted them near Ms residence when he was 



JOURNEY TO AMERICA 23 

teaching in the Auburn Academy for several 
years before his departure for Japan. These 
willows proved to be fine, handsome trees when 
I visited Auburn in 1854. 

From St. Helena we took a northwesterly 
course and struck the Gulf Stream, which, with 
the wind still fair and favorable, carried us to 
New York in a short time. We landed in New 
York on the 12th of April, 1847, after a passage 
of ninety-eight days of unprecedented fair 
weather. The New York of 1847 was altogether 
a different city from the New York of 1909. It 
was a city of only 250,000 or 300,000 inhabi- 
tants ; now it is a metropolis rivaling London in 
population, wealth and commerce. The whole 
of Manhattan Island is turned into a city of sky- 
scrapers, churches and palatial residences. 

Little did I realize when in 1845 I wrote, while 
in the Morrison School, a composition on "An 
Imaginary Voyage to New York and up the 
Hudson," that I was to see New York in reality. 
This incident leads me to the reflection that 
sometimes our imagination foreshadows what lies 
uppermost in our minds and brings possibilities 
within the sphere of realities. The Chinese 
Education Scheme is another example of the 
realities that came out of my day dreams a 



24 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

year before I graduated. So was my marrying 
an American wife. Still there are other day 
dreams yet to be realized; whether or no they 
will ever come to pass the future will determine. 

Our stay in New York was brief. The first 
friends we had the good fortune to make in the 
new world, were Prof. David E. Bartlett and 
his wife. He was a professor in the New York 
Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, and was after- 
wards connected with a like institution in Hart- 
ford. The Professor died in 1879. His wife, 
Mrs, Fanny P. Bartlett, survived him for nearly 
thirty years and passed away in the spring of 
1907. She was a woman highly respected and 
beloved for her high Christian character and un- 
ceasing activities for good in the community in 
which she lived. Her influence was even extend- 
ed to China by the few students who happened 
to enjoy her care and instruction. I count her 
as one of my most valued friends in America. 

From New York we proceeded by boat to 
New Haven where we had an opportunity to see 
Yale College and were introduced to President 
Day. I had not then the remotest idea of be- 
coming a graduate of one of the finest colleges 
of the country, as I did a few years afterwards. 
We went by rail from New Haven to Ware- 



JOURNEY TO AMERICA 25 

house Point and from there to East Windsor, 
the home of Mrs. Elizabeth Brown, wife of Dr. 
Brown. Her parents were then living. Her 
father, the Rev. Shuhael Bartlett, was the pastor 
of the East Windsor Congregational Church. I 
well remember the first Sabbath we attended his 
church. We three Chinese boys sat in the 
pastor's pew which was on the left of the pulpit, 
having a side view of the minister, but in full 
view of the whole congregation. We were the 
cynosure of the whole church, I doubt whether 
much attention was paid to the sermon that day. 
The Rev. Shubael Bartlett was a genuine type 
of the old New England Puritan. He was exact 
and precise in all his manners and ways. He 
spoke in a deliberate and solemn tone, but full of 
sincerity and earnestness. He conducted him- 
self as though he was treading on thin ice, cau- 
tiously and circumspectly. One would suppose 
from his appearance that he was austere and 
exacting, but he was gentle and thoughtful. He 
would have his family Bible and hymn book 
placed one on top of the other, squared and in 
straight lines, on the same spot on the table every 
morning for morning prayers. He always sat 
in the same spot for morning prayers. In other 
words, you always knew where to find him. His 



26 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

habits and daily life were as regular as clock 
work. I never heard him crack a joke or hurst 
out in open laughter. 

Mrs. Bartlett, Mrs. Brown's mother, was of 
a different makeup. She was always cheerful. 
A smile lighted up her features nearly all the 
time and for everyone she had a kind and cheer- 
ful word, while the sweet tone of her voice always 
carried with it cheerfulness and good will. Her 
genial temperament and her hospitality made 
the parsonage a favorite resort to all the friends 
and relatives of the family, who were quite 
numerous. It was always a puzzle to me how 
the old lady managed to make ends meet when 
her husband's salary was not over $400 a year. 
To be sure, the farm annually realized some- 
thing, but Daniel, the youngest son, who was the 
staff of the old couple, had to work hard to keep 
up the prestige of the parsonage. It was in this 
parsonage that I found a temporary home while 
at school in Monson, and also in Yale. 



CHAPTER IV 
AT MONSON ACADEMY 

We were in East Windsor for about a week; 
then we went up to Monson, Mass., to enter the 
Academy there. Monson Academy was, at one 
time, quite a noted preparatory school in New 
England, before high schools sprang into 
existence. Young men from all parts of the 
country were found here, undergoing prepara- 
tion for colleges. It was its fortune, at different 
periods of its history, to have had men of 
character and experience for its principals. The 
Rev. Charles Hammond was one of them. He 
was in every sense a self-made man. He 
was a graduate of Yale; he was enthusiasti- 
cally fond of the classics, and a great admirer 
of English literature. He was a man of 
liberal views and broad sympathies. He 
was well-known in New England as an educator 
and a champion of temperance and New Eng- 
land virtues. His high character gave the 
Academy a wide reputation and the school was 
never in a more prosperous condition than when 

27 



28 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

he was principal. He took a special interest in 
us, the three Chinese students Wong Shing, 
Wong Foon and myself not so much from the 
novelty of having Chinese in the school as from 
his interest in China,, and the possible good that 
might come out of our education. 

In our first year in the Academy, we were 
placed in the English department. Greenleaf s 
Arithmetic, English Grammar, Physiology, and 
Upham's Mental Philosophy were our studies. 
In the last two studies we recited to the new 
preceptress, Miss Rebekah Brown, a graduate 
of Mt. Holyoke, the valedictorian of her class. 
She afterwards became the wife of Doctor A. S. 
McClean, of Springfield, Mass. She was a fine 
teacher and a woman of exceptional Christian 
virtues. She had an even and sweet temper, and 
was full of good will and good works. She and 
her husband, the good Doctor, took a genuine 
interest in me; they gave me a home during some 
of my college vacations, and helped me in various 
ways in my struggle through Yale. I kept 
up my correspondence with them after my 
return to China, and upon my coming back to 
this country, I was always cordially invited to 
their home in Springfield. It was on account 
of such a genuine friendship that I made Spring- 



AT JUONSON ACADEMY 29 

field my headquarters in 1872, when I brought 
the first installment of Government students to 
this country. 

Brown placed us under the care of his mother, 
Mrs. Phoebe EL Brown. We boarded with her, 
but had a separate room assigned us in a dwell- 
ing right across the road, opposite to her 
cottage. Her widowed daughter with her three 
boys had taken up all the spare rooms in the 
cottage, which accounts for the want of accommo- 
dation for us. 

In those primitive days, board and lodging in 
the country were very reasonable. Indigent 
students had a fair chance to work their way for 
an education. I remember we paid for board 
and lodging, including fuel, light and washing, 
only $1.25 a week for each, but we had to take 
care of our own rooms and, in the winter, saw 
and split our own wood, which we found to be 
capital exercise. 

Our lodging was about half a mile from the 
academy. We had to walk three times a day to 
school and back, in the dead of winter when the 
snow was three feet deep ; that gave us plenty of 
exercise, keen appetites and kept us in fine con- 
dition. 

I look back upon my acquaintance with Mrs. 



30 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Phoebe H. Brown with a mingled feeling of 
respect and admiration. She certainly was a 
remarkable New England woman a woman of 
surpassing strength of moral and religious 
character. Those who have had the rare privilege 
of reading her stirring biography, will, I am 
sure, bear me out in this statement. She went 
through the crucible of unprecedented adversi- 
ties and trials of life and came out one of the 
rare shining lights that beautify the New Eng- 
land sky. She is the authoress of the well-known 
hymn, "I love to steal awhile away from every 
cumbering care," etc., which breathes the calm 
spirit of contentment and resignation wherever 
sung. 

The Rev. Charles Hammond, the principal 
of the academy when we joined it, was a grad- 
uate of Yale, as I stated before, and a man of 
a fine cultivated taste* He was an enthusiastic 
admirer of Shakespeare, who was his favorite 
poet; among orators, he was partial to Daniel 
Webster, He had the faculty of inspiring his 
pupils with the love of the beautiful, both in 
ancient and modern literature. In our daily 
recitations, he laid a greater stress on pointing 
out the beauties of a sentence and its construc- 
tion, than he did on grammatical rules, moods 



AT MONSON ACADEMY 31 

and tenses. He was a fine writer. His addresses 
and sermons were pointed and full of life. Like 
Dr. Arnold of Rugby, he aimed to build char- 
acter in his pupils and not to convert them into 
walking encyclopedias, or intelligent parrots. 
It was through him that I was introduced to 
Addison, Goldsmith, Dickens, Sir Walter Scott, 
the Edinburgh Reviews, Macaulay and Shake- 
speare, which formed the bulk of my reading 
while in Monson. 

During my first year in the Monson Academy, 
I had no idea of taking a collegiate course. It 
was well understood that I was to return to 
China at the end of 1849, and the appropriation 
was made to suit such a plan. In the fall of 
1848, after Wong Shing the eldest of the three 
of us had returned to China on account of his 
poor health, Wong Foon and myself, who were 
left behind to continue our studies for another 
year, frequently met to talk over future plans 
for the end of the prescribed time. We both 
decided finally to stay in this country to continue 
our studies, but the question arose, who was 
going to back us financially after 1849? This 
was the Gordian Knot. We concluded to consult 
Mr. Hammond and Mr. Brown on the subject. 
They both decided to have the matter referred to 



32 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

our patrons in Hong Kong. Reply came that 
if we wished to prosecute our studies after 1849, 
they would be willing to continue their support 
through a professional course, if we were willing 
to go over to Scotland to go through the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh. This was a generous and 
noble-hearted proposal. 

Wong Foon, on his part, after much delibera- 
tion, decided to accept the offer and go over to 
Scotland at the end of 1849, while, on my part, 
I preferred to remain in this country to continue 
my studies here with the view of going to Yale. 
Wong Foon's decision had relieved him of all 
financial anxieties, while the problem of how I 
was to pay my education bills after 1849, still 
remained to be solved. But I did not allow the 
perplexites of the future to disturb my peace of 
mind. I threw all my anxieties to the wind, 
trusting to a wise Providence to care for my 
future, as it had done for my past. 

Wong Foon and I, having taken our decisive 
steps, dropped our English studies at the close 
of the school year of 1849, and in the fall of the 
same year we began the A B C's of our classical 
course. In the summer of 1850, we graduated 
from the academy. Wong Foon, by previous 
arrangements, went over to Scotland and 



AT MONSON ACADEMY 33 

entered the University of Edinburgh. I re- 
mained in this country and finally entered Yale. 
It was fully a decade since we had met for the 
first time in the Morrison School in Macao, in 
1840, to become school-mates as well as class- 
mates. Now that link was broken. 

Wong was in the University seven years. 
After completing his professional studies as a 
doctor, he returned to China in 1857. He was 
a fine scholar. He graduated the third man in 
Ms medical class. He also distinguished himself 
in his profession. His ability and skill secured 
for him an enviable reputation as one of the 
ablest surgeons east of the Cape of Good Hope 
at that time. He had a fine practice in Canton, 
where the foreign residents retained him as their 
physician in preference to European doctors. 
He was very successful and made quite a fortune 
before his death, which took place in 1879. Both 
the native and foreign communities felt his loss. 
He was highly respected and honored by Chinese 
and foreigners for his Christian character and 
the purity of his life. 



CHAPTER V 
MY COLLEGE DAYS 

Before entering Yale, I had not solved the 
problem of how I was to be carried through the 
collegiate course without financial backing of a 
definite and well-assured character. It was an 
easy matter to talk about getting an education 
by working for it, and there is a kind of romance 
in it that captivates the imagination, but it is 
altogether a different thing to face it in a busi- 
ness and practical way. So it proved to me, 
after I had put my foot into it. I had no one 
except Brown, who had already done so much 
for me in bringing me to this country, and 
Hammond, who fitted me for college. To them 
I appealed for advice and counsel. I was ad- 
vised to avail myself of the contingent fund 
provided for indigent students. It was in the 
hands of the trustees of the academy and so 
well guarded that it could not be appropriated 
without the recipient's signing a written pledge 
that he would study for the ministry and after- 
wards become a missionary. Such being the 



MY COLLEGE DAYS 85 

case, I made up my mind that it would be 
utterly useless for me to apply for the fund. 
However, a day was appointed for me to meet 
the trustees in the parsonage, to talk over the 
subject. They said they would be too glad to 
have me avail myself of the fund, provided I was 
willing to sign a pledge that after graduation I 
should go back to China as a missionary. I gave 
the trustees to understand that I would never 
give such a pledge for the following reasons: 
First, it would handicap and circumscribe my 
usefulness. I wanted the utmost freedom of 
action to avail myself of every opportunity to 
do the greatest good in China. If necessary, I 
might be obliged to create new conditions, if I 
found old ones were not favorable to any plan I 
might have for promoting her highest welfare. 

In the second place, the calling of a missionary 
is not the only sphere in life where one can do the 
most good in China or elsewhere. In such a vast 
empire, there can be hardly any limit put upon 
one's ambition to do good, if one is possessed of 
the Christ-spirit; on the other hand, if one has 
not such a spirit, no pledge in the world could 
melt his ice-bound soul. 

In the third place, a pledge of that character 
would prevent me from taking advantage of any 



36 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

circumstance or event that might arise in the 
life of a nation like China, to do her a great 
service. 

'Tor these reasons/' I said, "I must decline 
to give the pledge and at the same time decline 
to accept your kind offer to help me. I thank 
you, gentlemen, very much, for your good 
wishes/' 

Both Brown and Hammond afterwards 
agreed that I took the right view on the subject 
and sustained me in my position. To be sure, 
I was poor, but I would not allow my poverty 
to gain the upper hand and compel me to barter 
away my inward convictions of duty for a 
temporary mess of pottage. 

During the summer of 1850, it seems that 
Brown who had been making a visit in the South 
to see his sister, while there had occasion to call 
on some of the members of "The Ladies' Associa- 
tion" in Savannah, Ga., to whom he mentioned 
my case. He returned home in the nick of time, 
just after I had the interview with the 
board of trustees of the academy. I told him 
of the outcome, when, as stated above, he 
approved of my position, and told me what he 
had done. He said that the members of the 
association agreed to help me in college. On 



MY COLLEGE DAYS 37 

the strength of that I gathered fresh courage, 
and went down to New Haven to pass my ex- 
amination for entrance. How I got in, I do not 
know, as I had had only fifteen months of Latin 
and twelve months of Greek, and ten months of 
mathematics. My preparation had been inter- 
rupted because the academy had been broken up 
by the Palmer & New London R,R. that was 
being built close by. As compared with 
the college preparations of nine-tenths of my 
class-mates, I was far behind. However, I 
passed without condition. But I was convinced 
I was not sufficiently prepared, as my recitations 
in the class-room clearly proved. Between the 
struggle of how to make ends meet financially 
and how to keep up with the class in my studies, 
I had a pretty tough time of it. I used to sweat 
over my studies till twelve o'clock every night 
the whole Freshman year. I took little or no 
exercise and my health and strength began to 
fail and I was obliged to ask for a leave of 
absence of a week. I went to East Windsor to 
get rested and came back refreshed. 

In the Sophomore year, from my utter aver- 
sion to mathematics, especially to differential 
and integral calculus, which I abhorred and 
detested, and which did me little or no good in 



38 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the way of mental discipline, I used to fizzle 
and flunk so often that I really thought I was 
going to be dropped from the class, or dismissed 
from college. But for some unexplained reasons 
I was saved from such a catastrophe, and I 
squeezed through the second year in college with 
so low a mark that I was afraid to ask my divi- 
sion tutor, who happened to be Tutor Blodget, 
who had me in Greek, about it. The only re- 
deeming feature that saved me as a student in 
the class of 1854, was the fortunate circumstance 
that I happened to be a successful competitor 
on two occasions in English composition in my 
division. I was awarded the first prize in the 
second term, and the first prize in the third term 
of the year. These prizes gave rne quite an eclat 
in the college as well as in the outside world, 
but I was not at all elated over them on account 
of my poor scholarship which I felt keenly 
through the whole college course. 

Before the close of my second year, I succeed- 
ed in securing the stewardship of a boarding 
club consisting of sophomores and juniors. 
There were altogether twenty members. I did 
all the marketing and served at the table. In 
this way, I earned my board through the latter 
half of my college course. In money matters, I 



MY COLLEGE DAYS 39 

was supplied with remittances from "The 
Ladies' Association" in Savannah, and also con- 
tributions from the Olyphant Brothers of New 
York. In addition to these sources of supply, I 
was paid for being an assistant librarian to the 
"Brothers in Unity," which was one of the two 
college debating societies that owned a library, 
and of which I was a member. 

In my senior year I was again elected librarian 
to the same Society and got $30.00. These 
combined sums were large enough to meet all my 
cash bills, since my wants had to be finely 
trimmed to suit the cloth. If most of the country 
parsons of that period could get along with a 
salary of $200 or $300 a year (supplemented, of 
course, with an annual donation party, which 
sometimes carried away more than it donated) , 
having as a general thing a large family to look 
after, I certainly ought to have been able to get 
through college with gifts of nearly a like 
amount, supplemented with donations of shirts 
and stockings from ladies who took an interest in 
my education. 

The class of 1854, to which I had the honor 
and the good fortune to belong, graduated nine- 
ty-eight all told. Being the first Chinaman who 
had ever been known to go through a first-class 



40 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

American college, I naturally attracted consid- 
erable attention; and from the fact that I was 
librarian for one of the college debating 
societies (Linonia was the other) for two years, 
I was known by members of the three classes 
above, and members of the three classes below 
me. This fact had contributed toward familiar- 
izing me with the college world at large, and my 
nationality, of course, added piquancy to my 
popularity. 

As an undergraduate, I had already acquired 
a factitious reputation within the walls of Yale. 
But that was ephemeral and soon passed out of 
existence after graduation. 

All through my college course, especially in 
the closing year, the lamentable condition of 
China was before my mind constantly and 
weighed on my spirits. In my despondency, I 
often wished I had never been educated, as 
education had unmistakably enlarged my mental 
and moral horizon, and revealed to me responsi- 
bilities which the sealed eye of ignorance can 
never see, and sufferings and wrongs of human- 
ity to which an uncultivated and callous nature 
can never be made sensitive. The more one. 
knows, the more he suffers and is consequently 
less happy; the less one knows, the less he suffers, 



MY COLLEGE DAYS 41 

and hence is more happy. But this is a low view 
of life, a cowardly feeling and unworthy of a 
being hearing the impress of divinity. I had 
started out to get an education. By dint of hard 
work and self-denial I had finally secured the 
coveted prize and although it might not be so 
complete and symmetrical a thing as could he 
desired, yet I had come right up to the conven- 
tional standard and idea of a liberal education. 
I could, therefore, call myself an educated man 
and, as such, it behooved me to ask, "What am 
I going to do with my education?" Before the 
close of my last year in college I had already 
sketched out what I should do. I was determined 
that the rising generation of China should enjoy 
the same educational advantages that I had en- 
joyed; that through western education China 
might be regenerated, become enlightened and 
powerful. To accomplish that object became the 
guiding star of my ambition. Towards such a 
goal, I directed all my mental resources and 
energy. Through thick and thin, and the vicissi- 
tudes of a checkered life from 1854 to 1872, I 
labored and waited for its consummation. 



CHAPTER VI 
RETURN TO CHINA 

In entering upon my life's work which to me 
was so full of meaning and earnestness, the first 
episode was a voyage back to the old country, 
which I had not seen for nearly ten years, but 
which had never escaped my mind's eye nor my 
heart's yearning for her welfare. I wanted very 
much to stay a few years longer in order to take 
a scientific course. I had taken up surveying in 
the Sheffield Scientific School just as that de- 
partment was starting into existence under 
Professor Norton. Had I had the means to 
prosecute a practical profession, that might have 
helped to shorten and facilitate the way to the 
goal I had in view; but as I was poor and my 
friends thought that a longer stay in this country 
might keep me here for good, and China would 
lose me altogether, I was for this and other 
reasons induced to return. The scientific course 
was accordingly abandoned. The persons who 
were most interested in my return to China were 
Pelatiah Perit of Messrs. Goodhue & Co., mer- 



RETURN TO CHINA 43 

chants in the China trade, and the Olyphant 
Brothers, who had taken such a lively interest 
eight years before in helping me to come over in 
their ship, the "Huntress." These gentlemen 
had no other motive in desiring me to return to 
China than that of hoping to see me useful in 
Christianizing the Chinese, which was in harmony 
with their well-known broad and benevolent 
characters. 

On the 13th of November, 1854, the Rev. 
William Allen Macy, who went out to Hong 
Kong to take the place of the Rev, Dr. Brown, 
as teacher in the Morrison Education Society 
School in 1845, went back to China as a mis- 
sionary under the American Board, and we were 
fellow-passengers on board the sailing clipper 
ship "Eureka," under Captain Whipple, of 
Messrs. Chamber, Heisser & Co., of New York. 

Winter is the worst season of the year to go 
on an eastern voyage in a sailing vessel, via the 
Cape of Good Hope. The northeast trade winds 
prevail then and one is sure to have head winds all 
the way. The "Eureka," in which Macy and 
myself were the only passengers, took that route 
to Hong Kong. We embarked on board of her 
as she rode in midstream of the East River. The 
day was bleak and bitingly cold. No handker- 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

chiefs were fluttering in the air, waving a good 
voyage; no sound from the shore cheered us as 
the anchor was weighed, and as the tug towed us 
out as far as Sandy Hook. There we were left 
to our own resources. The sails were not furled 
to their full extent, but were reefed for tacking, 
as the wind was nearly dead ahead and quite 
strong. We found the "Eureka" to be empty 
of cargo, and empty even of ballast of any 
kind; for that reason she acted like a sailor who 
had just had his nip before he went out to sea. 
She tossed up and down and twisted from right 
to left, just as though she had a little too much 
to keep her balance. It was in such a fashion that 
she reeled her way from Sandy Hook to Hong 
Kong a distance of nearly 13,000 nautical 
miles, which took her 154 days to accom- 
plish. It was decidedly the most uninteresting 
and wearisome voyage I ever took in my life. 
The skipper was a Philadelphian. He had the 
unfortunate habit of stuttering badly, which 
tended to irritate a temper naturally quick and 
fiery. He was certainly a ludicrous object to 
look at. It was particularly in the morning that 
he might be seen pacing the quarter deck, scan- 
ning the sky. This, by the spectator, was 
deemed necessary for the skipper to work him- 



RETURN TO CHINA 45 

self up to the right pitch, preliminary to his pan- 
tomimic performances in his hattle with the head 
wind. All at once, he halted, stared at the quar- 
ter of the sky from whence the malicious head 
wind came. With a face all bloated and red- 
dened by intense excitement, his eyes almost 
standing out of their sockets, and all ablaze with 
uncontrollable rage, with arms uplifted, he 
would clutch his hair as if plucking it out by the 
roots, gnash his teeth, and simultaneously he 
would jump up and down, stamping on the deck, 
and swear at the Almighty for sending him head 
winds. The air for the moment was split with 
his revolting imprecations and blasphemous 
oaths that were ejaculated through the laborious 
process of stammering and stuttering, which 
made him a most pitiable object to behold. In 
the early part of the voyage it was a painful 
sight to see him working himself up to that pitch 
of contortion and paroxysm of rage which made 
him appear more like an insane than a sane man, 
but as these exhibitions were of daily occurrence 
for the greater part of the voyage, we came to 
regard him as no longer deserving of sympathy 
and pity, but rather with contempt. After his 
passion had spent its force, and he subsided into 
his calmer and normal mood, he would drop 



46 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

limply into a cane chair, where he would sit for 
hours all by himself. For the sake of diversion, 
he would rub his hands together, and soliloquize 
quietly to himself, an occasional smile breaking 
over his face, which made him look like an inno- 
cent idiot. Before the voyage was half through, 
the skipper had made such a fool of himself 
through his silly and insane conduct about the 
wind, that he became the laughing stock of the 
whole crew, who, of course, did not dare to show 
any outward signs of insubordination. The sail- 
ing of the vessel was entirely in the hands of the 
first mate, who was literally a sea-tyrant. The 
crew was composed of Swedes and Norwegians. 
If it had been made up of Americans, the in- 
human treatment by the officers might have 
driven them to desperate extremities, because the 
men were over- worked night and day in incessant 
tacking. The only time that they found a 
resting spell was when the ship was becalmed in 
the tropics when not a breath of wind was to be 
had for several days at a time. Referring to my 
diary kept in that memorable voyage, it took 
us nearly two weeks to beat up the Macassar 
straits. This event tried our patience sorely. 
After it was passed, the skipper made the 
remark within the hearing of the Rev, Macy 



RETURN TO CHINA 47 

that the reason he had bad luck was because he 
had a Jonah on board. My friend Macy took 
the remark in a good-natured way and gave me 
a significant smile. We were just then discuss- 
ing the feat of going through the Macassar 
straits and I remarked in a tone just loud 
enough to be heard by the old skipper that if I 
had charge of the vessel, I could take her through 
in less than ten days. This was meant as a direct 
reflection on the poor seamanship of the old 
fellow (for he really was a miserable sailor), as 
well as to serve as a retaliation for what he said 
a few minutes before, that there was a Jonah on 
board. 

In the dead of winter, the passage to the East 
should have been taken around Cape Horn 
instead of the Cape of Good Hope, in which 
case we would no doubt have had strong and fair 
wind all the way from New York to Hong 
Kong, which would not only have shortened the 
voyage but also saved the captain a world of 
swearing and an incalculable amount of wear 
and tear on his nervous system. But as a pas- 
senger only, I had no idea of the financial motive 
back of the move to send the ship off perfectly 
empty and unballasted, right in the teeth of the 
northeast monsoon. I would have been glad to 



48 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

go around Cape Horn, as that would have added 
a new route to my journeying around the world, 
and furnished me with new incidents as well. 

As we approached Hong Kong, a Chinese 
pilot boarded us. The captain wanted me to ask 
him whether there were any dangerous rocks and 
shoals nearby. I could not for the life of me 
recall my Chinese in order to interpret for him; 
the pilot himself understood English, and he was 
the first Chinese teacher to give me the terms in 
Chinese for dangerous rocks and shoals. So the 
skipper and Macy, and a few other persons who 
were present at the time, had the laugh on me, 
who, being a Chinese, yet was not able to speak 
the language. 

My first thought upon landing was to walk up 
to the office of the "China Mail," to pay my 
respects to Andrew Shortrede, the proprietor 
and editor of the paper, and the friend who sup- 
ported me for over a year, while I was in 
Monson Academy. After seeing him and 
accepting his hospitality by way of an invitation 
to take up my quarters in his house, I lost no 
time in hastening over to Macao to see my aged 
and beloved mother, who, I knew, yearned to 
see her long-absent boy. Our meeting was 
arranged a day beforehand. I was in citizen's 



RETURN TO CHINA 49 

dress and could not conveniently change the 
same for my Chinese costume. I had also 
allowed a pair of mustaches to grow, which, 
according to Chinese custom, was not becoming 
for an unmarried young man to do. We met 
with tears of joy, gratitude and thanksgiving. 
Our hearts were too full even to speak at first. 
We gave way to our emotions. As soon as we 
were fairly composed, she began to stroke me all 
over, as expressive of her maternal endearment 
which had been held in patient suspense for at 
least ten years. As we sat close to each other, I 
gave her a brief recital of my life in America, 
for I knew she would be deeply interested in the 
account. I told her that I had just finished a 
long and wearisome voyage of five months' dura- 
tion, but had met with no danger of any kind ; that 
during my eight years of sojourn in the United 
States, I was very kindly treated by the good 
people everywhere; that I had had good health 
and never been seriously sick, and that my chief 
object during the eight years was to study and 
prepare myself for my life work in China. I 
explained to her that I had to go through a 
preparatory school before entering college; that 
the college I entered was Yale one of the lead- 
ing colleges of the United States, and that the 



50 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

course was four years, which accounted for my 
long stay and delayed my return to China. I 
told her that at the end of four years I had grad- 
uated with the degree of A.B., analogous to the 
Chinese title of Siu Tsai, which is interpreted 
"Elegant Talent;" that it was inscribed on a 
parchment of sheep skin and that to graduate 
from Yale College was considered a great honor, 
even to a native American, and much more so to 
a Chinese. She asked me naively how much 
money it conferred. I said it did not confer any 
money at once, hut it enabled one to make money 
quicker and easier than one can who has not been 
educated ; that it gave one greater influence and 
power among men and if he built on his college 
education, he would be more likely to become the 
leader of men, especially if he had a well-estab- 
lished character. I told her my college education 
was worth more to me than money, and that I 
was confident of making plenty of money, 

"Knowledge," I said, "is power, and power is 
greater than riches. I am the first Chinese to 
graduate from Yale College, and that being the 
case, you have the honor of being the first and 
only mother out of the countless millions of 
mothers in China at this time, who can claim the 
honor of having a son who is the first Chinese 



RETURN TO CHINA 51 

graduate of a first-class American college. Such 
an honor is a rare thing to possess." I also 
assured her that as long as I lived all her com- 
forts and wants would be scrupulously and 
sedulously looked after, and that nothing would 
be neglected to make her contented and happy. 
This interview seemed to give her great comfort 
and satisfaction. She seemed very happy over 
it. After it was ended, she looked at me with a 
significant smile and said, "I see you have 
already raised your mustaches. You know you 
have a brother who is much older than you are ; 
he hasn't grown his mustaches yet. You must 
have yours off," I promptly obeyed her mandate, 
and as I entered the room with a clean face, she 
smiled with intense satisfaction, evidently think- 
ing that with all my foreign education, I had not 
lost my early training of being obedient to my 
mother. And if she could only have read my 
heart, she would have found how every throb 
palpitated with the most tender love for her. 
During the remaining years of her life, I had 
the rare privilege of seeing her often and 
ministered to her every comfort that it was in 
my power to bestow. She passed away in 1858, 
at the age of sixty-four, twenty-four years after 
the death of my father. I was in Shanghai at 



52 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the time of her death. I returned to my native 
village in time to attend her funeral. 

In the summer of 1855, I took up my resi- 
dence in Canton, with the Rev. Mr. Vrooman, 
a missionary under the American Board. His 
headquarters were in Ham Ha Lan, in the 
vicinity of the government execution ground, 
which is in the southwestern outskirts of the 
city, close to the bank of the Pearl River. While 
there, I began my Chinese studies and com- 
menced to regain the dialect of Canton, which 
I had forgotten during my stay in the United 
States. In less than six months, the language 
came back to me readily, although I was still a 
little rusty in it. I was also making slow progress 
in recovering the written language, in which I 
was not well-grounded before leaving China, in 
1846. I had studied it only four years, which 
was considered a short time in which to master 
the written language. There is a greater dif- 
ference between the written and the spoken 
language of China than there is between the 
written and spoken English language. The 
Chinese written language is stilted and full of 
conventional forms. It is understood through- 
out the whole empire, but differently pronounced 
in different provinces and localities. The 



RETURN TO CHINA 53 

spoken language is cut up Into endless dialects 
and in certain provinces like Fuhkien, Anliui 
and Kiangsu, the people are as foreigners to 
each other in the matter of dialects. Such are 
the peculiar characteristics of the ideographic 
and spoken languages of China. 

During the six months of my residence in 
Canton, while trying to recover both the written 
and spoken languages, Kwang Tung province 
was thrown into a somewhat disorganized 
condition. The people of Canton attempted to 
raise a provincial insurrection or rebellion 
entirely distinct from the Taiping rebellion 
which was being carried on in the interior of 
China with marked success. To suppress and 
nip it in the bud, drastic measures were resorted 
to by Viceroy Yeh Ming Hsin, who, in the 
summer of 1855, decapitated seventy-five thou- 
sand people, most of whom, I was told, were 
innocent. My residence was within half a mile 
of the execution ground, as stated above, and one 
day, out of curiosity, I ventured to walk over 
to the place. But, oh ! what a sight. The ground 
was perfectly drenched with human blood. On 
both sides of the driveway were to be seen head- 
less human trunks, piled up in heaps, waiting to 
be taken away for burial. But no provision 



54 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

had been made to facilitate their removal. 
The execution was carried on on a larger scale 
than had been expected, and no provision had 
been made to find a place large enough to bury 
all the bodies. There they were, left exposed 
to a burning sun. The temperature stood from 
morning to night in midsummer steadily at 90 
Fahrenheit, and sometimes higher. The atmos- 
phere within a radius of two thousand yards of 
the execution ground was heavily charged with 
the poisonous and pestilential vapor that was 
reeking from the ground already over-saturated 
with blood and from the heaps of corpses which 
had been left behind for at least two days, and 
which showed signs of rapid decomposition. It 
was a wonder to me that no virulent epidemic 
had sprung up from such an infectious spot to 
decimate the compact population of the city of 
Canton. It was a fortunate circumstance that 
at last a deep and extensive ravine, located in 
the far-off outskirts of the western part of the 
city, was found, which was at once con- 
verted into a sepulchral receptacle into which 
this vast human hecatomb was dumped. It was 
said that no earth was needed to be thrown over 
these corpses to cover them up; the work was 
accomplished by countless swarms of worms of a 



RETURN TO CHINA 55 

reddish hue and of an appearance that was per- 
fectly hideous and revolting. 

I was told that during the months of June, 
July and August, of 1855, seventy-five thousand 
people had been decapitated; that more than half 
of that number were declared to be innocent of the 
charge of rebellion, but that the accusation was 
made as a pretext to exact money from them* 
This wholesale slaughter, unparalleled in the 
annals of modern civilization, eclipsing even the 
enormities and blood-thirstiness of Caligula and 
Nero, or even the French Revolution, was per- 
petrated by Yeh Ming Hsin, who was appointed 
viceroy of Kwang Tung and Kwangsi in 
1854. 

Yeh Ming Hsin was a native of Han- Yang. 
Han- Yang is a part of the port of Hankau, and 
was destroyed with it when the Taiping rebels 
took possession of it. It was said that Yeh 
Ming Hsin had immense estates in Han- Yang, 
which were completely destroyed by fire. This 
circumstance embittered him towards the Tai- 
ping rebels and as the Taiping leaders hailed 
from Kwang Tung and Kwangsi, he naturally 
transferred his hatred to the people of those two 
provinces. It was in the lofty position of a 
viceroy that he found his opportunity to wreak 



56 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

his private and personal vengeance upon the 
Canton people. This accounts for his indiscrim- 
inate slaughter of them, and for the fact that he 
did not deign to give them even the semblance 
of a trial, but hurried them from life to death 
like packs of cattle to the shambles. 

But this human monster did not dream that 
his day of reckoning was fast approaching. 
Several years after this appalling sacrifice of 
human life, in 1855, he got into trouble with 
the British government. He was captured by 
the British forces and banished to some obscure 
and remote corner in India where he led a 
most ignominious life, hated by the whole 
Chinese nation, and despised by the world at 
large. 

On my return to headquarters, after my visit 
to the execution ground, I felt faint-hearted and 
depressed in spirit. I had no appetite for food, 
and when night came, I was too nervous for 
sleep. The scene I had looked upon during the 
day had stirred me up. I thought then that the 
Taiping rebels had ample grounds to justify 
their attempt to overthrow the Manchu regime. 
My sympathies were thoroughly enlisted in their 
favor and I thought seriously of making prepa- 
rations to join the Taiping rebels, but upon a 



RETURN TO CHINA 57 

calmer reflection, I fell back on the original plan 
of doing my best to recover the Chinese lan- 
guage as fast as I possibly could and of following 
the logical course of things, in order to accom- 
plish the object I had at heart. 



CHAPTER VII 
EFFORT TO FIND A POSITION 

Having at last succeeded in mastering the 
spoken language sufficiently to speak it quite 
fluently, I at once set to work to find a position 
in which I could not only support myself and 
mother, but also form a plan for working out my 
ideas of reform in China. 

Doctor Peter Parker, who had been a medical 
missionary under the American Board for many 
years in Canton, was at that time made United 
States Commissioner as a temporary expedient, 
to take the place of an accredited minister pleni- 
potentiary a diplomatic appointment not yet 
come into existence, because the question of a 
foreign minister resident in Peking was still 
under negotiation, and had not been fully set- 
tled as a permanent diplomatic arrangement 
between the Peking government and the Treaty 
Powers. Dr. Parker was given the appointment 
of commissioner on account of his long residence 
in China and his ability to speak the Chinese 

language, but not on account of any special 

58 



EFFORT TO FIND A POSITION 59 

training as a diplomat, nor for legal knowledge, 
It was through Mr. M. N. Hitchcock, an 
American merchant of the firm of Messrs* King 
& Co., and a mutual friend of Dr. Parker and 
myself, that I hecame the Doctor's private 
secretary. I knew Dr. Parker while I was at 
Mrs. GutzlafFs School, and he doubtless knew 
I had recently graduated from Yale, which was 
his Alma Mater also. His headquarters were 
in Canton, but he spent his summers in Macao. 
I was with him only three months. My salary 
was $15 a month (not large enough to spoil me 
at any rate) . He had very little for me to do, but 
I thought that by being identified with him, 
I might possibly come in contact with Chinese 
officials. However, this was far from being the 
case. Seeing that I could neither learn anything 
from him, nor enlarge my acquaintance with the 
Chinese officials, I gave up my position as his 
secretary and went over to Hong Kong to try 
to study law. Through my old friend, Andrew 
Shortrede, who generously extended to me the 
hospitality of his house, I succeeded in securing 
the position of the interpretership in the Hong 
Kong Supreme Court. The situation paid me 
$75 a month. Having this to fall back upon, 
I felt encouraged to go ahead in my effort to 



60 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

study law. Accordingly, I was advised to 
apprentice myself to an attorney or solicitor- 
at-law. In the English court of practice, it 
seems that there are two distinct classes of 
lawyers attorneys or solicitors, and barristers. 
.The first prepares in writing all evidences, facts, 
and proofs of a case, hands them to the barrister 
or counsel, who argues the case in court accord- 
ing to law. 

I apprenticed myself to an attorney, who was 
recommended to me by my old patron and 
friend, Shortrede. I was not aware that by 
going into the British Colony in Hong Kong 
to become an attorney, I was stepping on the 
toes of the British legal fraternity, nor that by 
apprenticing myself to an attorney instead of to 
the new attorney-general of the Colony, who, 
without my knowledge, wanted me himself, I 
had committed another mistake, which event- 
ually necessitated my leaving Hong Kong 
altogether. 

First of all, all the attorneys banded them- 
selves together against me, because, as they 
openly stated in all the local papers except the 
"China Mail," if I were allowed to practice my 
profession, they might as well pack up and go 
back to England, for as I had a complete knowl- 



EFFORT TO FIND A POSITION 61 

edge of both English and Chinese I would 
eventually monopolize all the Chinese legal 
business. So they made it too hot for me to 
continue in my studies. 

In the next place, I was not aware that the 
attorney-general wanted me to apprentice 
myself to him, for he did all he could in his 
capacity as attorney-general of the Colony to 
use his influence to open the way for me to 
become an attorney, by draughting a special 
colonial ordinance to admit Chinese to practice 
in the Hong Kong Colony as soon as I could 
pass my examinations. This ordinance was 
sent to the British government to be sanctioned 
by Parliament before it became valid and a 
colonial law. It was sanctioned and thus became 
a colonial ordinance. 

In the meanwhile, Anstey, the attorney- 
general, found out that I had already appren- 
ticed myself to Parson, the attorney. From 
that time forth I had no peace. I was between 
two fires the batteries operated by the attor- 
neys opened on me with redoubled energy, and 
the new battery, operated by the attorney-gen- 
eral, opened its fire. He found fault with my 
interpreting, which he had never done previously. 
Mr. Parson saw how things stood. He himself 



62 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

was also under a hot fire from both sides. So 
in order to save himself, he told me plainly and 
candidly that he had to give me up and made the 
article of apprenticeship between us null and 
void. I, on my part, had to give up my position 
as interpreter in the Supreme Court. Parson, 
himself, not long after I had abandoned my 
apprenticeship and my position as interpreter, 
for reasons satisfactory to himself, gave up his 
business in Hong Kong and returned to Eng- 
land. So master and pupil left their posts at 
pretty nearly the same time. 

A retrospective view of my short experience 
in Hong Kong convinced me that it was after 
all the best thing that I did not succeed in 
becoming a lawyer in Hong Kong, as the theatre 
of action there would have been too restricted 
and circumscribed. I could not have come in 
touch with the leading minds of China, had I 
been bound up in that rocky and barren Colony. 
Doubtless I might have made a fortune if I had 
succeeded in my legal profession, but as circum- 
stances forced me to leave the Colony, my mind 
was directed northward to Shanghai, and in 
August, 1856, I left Hong Kong in the tea 
clipper, "Florence," under Captain Dumaresque, 
of Boston, He was altogether a different type 



EFFORT TO FIND A POSITION 63 

of man from the captain of the "Eureka" 
which brought me out in 1855. He was kind, 
intelligent and gentlemanly. When he found 
out who I was, he offered me a free passage 
from Hong Kong to Shanghai, He was, in 
fact, the sole owner of the vessel, which was 
named after his daughter, Florence. The pas- 
sage was a short one lasting only seven days 
but before it was over, we became great friends. 

Not long after my arrival in Shanghai, I 
found a situation in the Imperial Customs 
Translating Department, at a salary of Tls. 75 
a month, equivalent to $100 Mexican. For want 
of a Chinese silver currency the Mexican dollar 
was adopted. This was one point better than 
the interpretership in the Hong Kong Supreme 
Court. The duties were not arduous and trying. 
In fact, they were too simple and easy to suit 
my taste and ambition. I had plenty of time to 
read. Before three months of trial in my new 
situation, I found that things were not as they 
should be, and if I wished to keep a clean and 
clear record and an untarnished character, I 
could not remain long in the service. Between 
the interpreters who had been in the service many 
years and the Chinese shippers there existed a 
regular system of graft. After learning this, 



64 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and not wishing to be implicated with the others 
in the division of the spoils in any way or shape, 
I made up my mind to resign. So one day I 
called upon the Chief Commissioner of Customs, 
ostensibly to find out what my future prospects 
were in connection with the Customs Service 
whether or not there were any prospects of my 
being promoted to the position of a commis- 
sioner, I was told that no such prospects were 
held out to me or to any other Chinese interpre- 
ter. I, therefore, at once decided to throw up 
my position. So I sent in my resignation, which 
was at first not accepted. A few days after my 
first interview, Lay, the chief commissioner, 
strenuously tried to persuade me to change my 
mind, and offered as an inducement to raise my 
salary to Tls. 200 a month, evidently thinking 
that I was only bluffing in order to get higher 
wages. It did not occur to him that there was at 
least one Chinaman who valued a clean reputa- 
tion and an honest character more than money; 
that being an educated man, I saw no reason 
why I should not be given the same chances to 
rise in the service of the Chinese government as 
an Englishman, nor why my individuality should 
not be recognized and respected in every walk 
of life. He little thought that I had aspirations 



EFFORT TO FIND A POSITION 65 

even higher than his, and that I did not care 
to associate myself with a pack of Custom-house 
interpreters and inspectors, who were known to 
take bribes; that a man who expects others to 
respect him, must first respect himself. Such 
were my promptings, I did not state the real 
cause of my quitting the service, but at the 
end of four months' trial I left the service in 
order to try my fortune in new fields more 
congenial. 

My friends at the time looked upon me as a 
crank in throwing up a position yielding me 
Tls, 200 a month for something uncertain and 
untried. This in their estimation was the height 
of folly. They little realized what I was driving 
at. I had a clean record and I meant to keep it 
clean. I was perfectly aware that in less than 
a year since my return to China, I had made 
three shifts. I myself began to think I was 
too mercurial to accomplish anything substan- 
tial, or that I was too dreamy to be practical or 
too proud to succeed in life. But in a strenuous 
life one needs to be a dreamer in order to accom- 
plish possibilities. We are not called into being 
simply to drudge for an animal existence. I 
had had to work hard for my education, and I 
felt that I ought to make the most of what little 



66 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

I had, not so much to benefit myself individually 
as to make it a blessing common to my race. By 
these shifts and changes I was only trying to 
find my true bearing, and how I could make 
myself a blessing to China- 



CHAPTER VIII 
EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 

The next turn I took, after leaving the 
Imperial Customs, was clerk in an English 
house tea and silk merchants. During the 
few months that I was with them, I gained quite 
an insight into mercantile business, and the 
methods of conducting it, which proved to be 
profitable knowledge and experience to me later 
on. Six months after I had entered upon my 
new sphere as a make-shift, the firm dissolved 
partnership, which once more threw me out of 
a position, and I was again cast upon the sea 
of uncertainty. But during my connection with 
the firm, two little incidents occurred which I 
must not fail to relate. 

One Thursday evening, as I was returning 
home from a prayer meeting held in the Union 
Chapel in Shanghai, I saw ahead of me on 
Szechuen Road in front of the Episcopal 
church, a string of men; each had a Chinese lan- 
tern swinging in the air over his head, and they 
were singing and shouting as they zigzagged 

67 



68 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

along the road, evidently having a jolly, good 
time, while Chinese on hoth sides of the road 
were seen dodging and scampering about in 
great fright in all directions, and acting as though 
they were chased by the Old Nick himself. I 
was at a distance of about one hundred yards 
from the scene. I took in the situation at once. 
My servant, who held a lantern ahead of me, to 
light the way, was so frightened that he began 
to come back towards me. I told him not to be 
afraid, but walk right straight ahead. Pretty 
soon we confronted three or four of the fellows, 
half tipsy. One of them snatched the lantern 
from my servant and another, staggering about, 
tried to give me a kick. I walked along coolly 
and unconcerned till I reached the last batch of 
two or three fellows. I found these quite sober 
and In their senses and they were lingering be- 
hind evidently to enjoy the fun and watch the 
crowd in their hilarious antics. I stopped and 
parleyed with them, and told them who I 
was, I asked them for the names of the 
fellows who snatched my boy's lantern and of 
the fellow who tried to kick me. They deelined 
at first, but finally with the promise that I would 
not give them any trouble, they gave me the 
name of one of the fellows, his position on the 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 69 

vessel, and the name of the vessel he belonged 
to. It turned out that the man was the first 
mate of the ship "Eureka," the very vessel that 
brought me out to China, in 1855, and which 
happened to be consigned to the firm I was 
working for. The next morning, I wrote a note 
to the captain, asking him to hand the note to 
his first officer. The captain, on receiving the 
note, was quite excited, and handed it to the first 
mate, who immediately came ashore and apol- 
ogized. I made it very pleasant for him and 
told him that Americans in China were held in 
high esteem by the people, and every American 
landing in China should be jealous of the high 
estimation in which they were held and not do 
anything to compromise it. My motive in 
writing the note was merely to get him on shore 
and give him this advice. He was evidently 
pleased with my friendly attitude and extended 
his hand for a shake to thank me for the advice. 
He invited me to go on board with him to take a 
glass of wine and be good friends. I thanked 
him for his offer, but declined it, and we parted 
in an amicable way. 

My second incident, which happened a couple 
of months after the first, did not have such a 
peaceful ending. 



70 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

After the partnership of the firm, in whose 
employ I was, dissolved, an auction sale of the 
furniture of the firm took place. In the room 
where the auction was proceeding, I happened 
to be standing in a mixed crowd of Chinese 
and foreigners. A stalwart six-footer of a 
Scotchman happened to be standing behind 
me. He was not altogether a stranger to me, 
for I had met him in the streets several times. 
He began to tie a bunch of cotton balls to my 
queue, simply for a lark. But I caught him at 
it and in a pleasant way held it up and asked 
him to untie it. He folded up his arms and drew 
himself straight up with a look of the utmost 
disdain and scorn. I at once took in the situa- 
tion, and as my countenance sobered, I reiterated 
my demand to have the appendage taken off. 
All of a sudden, he thrust his fist against my 
mouth, without drawing any blood, however. 
Although he stood head and shoulders above me 
in height, yet I was not at all abashed or intimi- 
dated by his burly and contemptuous appear- 
ance. My dander was up and oblivious to all 
thoughts of our comparative size and strength, 
I struck him back in the identical place where 
he punched me, but iny blow was a stinger and 
it went with lightning rapidity to the spot* 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 71 

without giving him time to think. It drew blood 
in great profusion from lip and nose. He 
caught me by the wrist with both his hands. As 
he held my right wrist in his powerful grasp, for 
he was an athlete and a sportsman, I was just 
on the point of raising my right foot for a kick, 
which was aimed at a vital point, when the head 
partner of the firm, who happened to be near, 
suddenly stepped in between and separated us. 
I then stood off to one side, facing my antag- 
onist, who was moving off into the crowd. As I 
moved away, I was asked by a voice from the 
crowd : 

"Do you want to fight?" 

I said, "No, I was only defending myself. 
Your friend insulted me and added injury to 
insult. I took him for a gentleman, but he has 
proved himself a blackguard." 

With this stinging remark, which was heard 
all over the room, I retired from the scene into 
an adjoining room, leaving the crowd to com- 
ment on the incident. The British Consul, who 
happened to be present on the occasion, made a 
casual remark on the merits of the case and 
said, as I was told afterwards by a friend, that 
"The young man was a little too fiery; if he 
had not taken the law into his own hands, he 



72 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

could have brought suit for assault and battery 
in the consular court, but since he has already 
retaliated and his last remark before the crowd 
has inflicted a deeper cut to his antagonist than 
the blow itself, he has lost the advantage of a 
suit" 

The Scotchman, after the incident, did not 
appear in public for a whole week. I was told 
he had shut himself up in his room to give his 
wound time to heal, but the reason he did not 
care to show himself was more on account of 
being whipped by a little Chinaman in a public 
manner; for the affair, unpleasant and unfor- 
tunate as it was, created quite a sensation in the 
settlement. It was the chief topic of conversa- 
tion for a short time among foreigners, while 
among the Chinese I was looked upon with great 
respect, for since the foreign settlement on the 
extra-territorial basis was established close to 
the city of Shanghai, no Chinese within its juris- 
diction had ever been known to have the courage 
and pluck to defend his rights, point blank, when 
they had been violated or trampled upon by a 
foreigner. Their meek and mild disposition had 
allowed personal insults and affronts to pass 
unresented and unchallenged, which naturally 
had the tendency to encourage arrogance and 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 73 

insolence on the part of ignorant foreigners. 
The time will soon come, however, when the 
people of China will be so educated and enlight- 
ened as to know what their rights are, public 
and private, and to have the moral courage to 
assert and defend them whenever they are 
invaded. The triumph of Japan over Russia in 
the recent war has opened the eyes of the 
Chinese world. It will never tolerate injustice 
in any way or shape, much less will it put up 
with foreign aggression and aggrandizement 
any longer. They see now in what plight their 
national ignorance, conceit and conservatism, in 
which they had been fossilized, had placed them. 
They were on the verge of being partitioned by 
the European Powers and were saved from that 
catastrophe only by the timely intervention of the 
United States government. What the future 
will bring forth, since the Emperor Kwangsu 
and Dowager Empress Chi Hsi have both 
passed away, no one can predict. 

The breaking up of the firm by which I was 
employed, once more, as stated before, and for 
the fourth time, threw me out of a regular busi- 
ness. But I was not at all disconcerted or 
discouraged, for I had no idea of following a 
mercantile life as a permanent calling. Within 



74 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the past two years, my knowledge of the Chinese 
language had decidedly improved. I was not in 
hot haste to seek for a new position. I imme- 
diately took to translating as a means of bridg- 
ing over the breaks of a desultory life. This 
independent avocation, though not a lucrative 
one, nevertheless led the way to a wider 
acquaintance with the educated and mercantile 
classes of the Chinese; to widen my acquaintance 
was my chief concern. My translating business 
brought me in contact with the comprador of 
one of the leading houses in Shanghai. The 
senior partner of this house died in 1857. He 
was well-known and thought much of by both 
the Chinese and the foreign mercantile body. To 
attest their high regard for his memory, the 
prominent Chinese merchants drew up an elab- 
orate and eulogistic epitaph on the occasion of 
his death. The surviving members of the firm 
selected two translators to translate the epitaph. 
One was the interpreter in the British Consulate 
General, a brother to the author of "The Chinese 
and their Rebellions/' and the other was 
(through the influence of the comprador) my- 
self. To my great surprise, my translation was 
given the preference and accepted by the man- 
ager of the firm. The Chinese committee were 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 75 

quite elated that one of their countrymen knew 
enough English to bring out the inner sense of 
their epitaph. It was adopted and engraved on 
the monument. My name began to be known 
among the Chinese, not as a fighter this time, 
but as a Chinese student educated in America, 

Soon after this performance, another event 
unexpectedly came up in which I was again 
called upon to act; that was the inundation of the 
Yellow River, which had converted the northern 
part of Kiangsu province into a sea, and made 
homeless and destitute thousands of people of 
that locality. A large body of refugees had 
wandered to and flocked near Shanghai. A 
Chinese deputation, consisting of the leading 
merchants and gentry, who knew or had heard of 
me, called and asked me to draw up a circular 
appealing to the foreign community for aid and 
contributions to relieve the widespread suffering 
among the refugees. Several copies were imme- 
diately put into circulation and in less than a 
week, no less than $20,000 were subscribed and 
paid. The Chinese Committee were greatly 
elated over their success and their joy was 
unbounded. To give a finishing touch to this 
stroke of business, I wrote in the name of the 
committee a letter of acknowledgment and 



76 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

thanks to the foreign community for the prompt 
and generous contribution it had made. This 
was published in the Shanghai local papers 
"The Shanghai Mail" and "Friend of China" so 
that inside of three months after I had started 
my translating business, I had become widely 
known among the Chinese as the Chinese student 
educated in America. I was indebted to Tsang 
Kee Foo, the comprador, for being in this line 
of business, and for the fact that I was becoming 
known in Shanghai. He was a well-educated 
Chinese a man highly respected and trusted 
for his probity and intelligence. His long con- 
nection with the firm and his literary taste had 
gathered around him some of the finest Chinese 
scholars from all parts of China, while his 
business transactions brought him in touch with 
the leading Chinese capitalists and business men 
in Shanghai and elsewhere. It was through him 
that both the epitaph and the circular men- 
tioned above were written; and it was Tsang 
Kee Foo who introduced me to the celebrated 
Chinese mathematician, Li Jen Shu, who years 
afterwards brought me to the notice of Viceroy 
Tsang Kwoh Fan the distinguished general 
and statesman, who, as will be seen hereafter, 
took up and promoted the Chinese Education 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 7T 

Scheme. In the great web of human affairs, it 
is almost impossible to know who among our 
friends and acquaintances may prove to be the 
right clue to unravel the skein of our destiny. 
Tsang Kee Foo introduced me to Li Jen Shu, 
the latter introduced me to Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
who finally through the Chinese Education 
Scheme grafted Western education to the Orien- 
tal culture, a union destined to weld together the 
different races of the world into one brotherhood. 
My friend Tsang Kee Foo afterwards intro- 
duced me to the head or manager of Messrs. 
Dent & Co,, who kindly offered me a position in 
his firm as comprador in Nagasaki, Japan, soon 
after that country was opened to foreign trade. 
I declined the situation, frankly and plainly 
stating my reason, which was that the com- 
pradorship, though lucrative, is associated with 
all that is menial, and that as a graduate 
of Yale, one of the leading colleges in America, 
I could not think of bringing discredit to my 
Alma Mater, for which I entertained the most 
profound respect and reverence, and was jealous 
of her proud fame. What would the college and 
my class-mates think of me, if they should hear 
that I was a comprador the head servant of 
servants in an English establishment? I said 



78 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

there were cases when a man from stress of 
circumstances may be compelled to play the part 
of a menial for a shift, but I was not yet reduced 
to that strait, though I was poor financially. I 
told him I would prefer to travel for the firm as 
its agent in the interior and correspond directly 
with the head of the firm. In that case, I would 
not sacrifice my manhood for the sake of making 
money in a position which is commonly held to 
be servile, I would much prefer to pack tea and 
buy silk as an agent either on a salary or on 
commission. Such was my ground for declining. 
I, however, thanked him for the offer. This inter- 
view took place in the presence of my friend, 
Tsang Kee Foo, who without knowing the 
details of the conversation, knew enough of the 
English language to follow the general tenor of 
the talk. I then retired and left the manager 
and my friend to talk over the result. Tsang 
afterwards told me that Webb said, "Yung 
Wing is poor but proud. Poverty and pride 
usually go together, hand in hand." A few days 
afterwards Tsang informed me that Webb had 
decided to send me to the tea districts to see and 
learn the business of packing tea. 



CHAPTER IX 

MY FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA 
DISTRICTS 

On the llth of March, 1859, I found myself 
on board of a Woo-Sik-Kwei, a Chinese boat 
built in Woo-Sik, a city situated on the borders 
of the Grand Canal, within a short distance of 
the famous city of Suchau a rival of the city of 
Hangchau, for wealth, population, silk manu- 
facture, and luxury. The word "Kwei" means 
"fast." Therefore, Woo-Sik-Kwei means fast 
boats of Woo-Sik. These passenger boats which 
plied between the principal cities and marts 
situated near the waters of the canal and lake 
system in southern Kianksu, were usually built 
of various sizes and nicely fitted up for the com- 
fort and convenience of the public. Those 
intended for officials, and the wealthy classes, 
were built on a larger scale and fitted up in a 
more pretentious style. They were all flat- 
bottom boats. They sailed fairly well before 

the wind, but against it, they were either tracked 

79 



80 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

by lines from the mast to the trackers on shore, 
or by sculling, at which the Chinese are adepts. 
They can give a boat a great speed by a pair of 
sculls resting on steel pivots that are fastened at 
the stern, one on each side, about the middle of 
the scull, with four men on each scull; the blades 
are made to play in the water astern, right and 
left, which pushes and sends the boat forward at 
a surprisingly rapid rate. But in recent years, 
steam has made its way into China and steam 
launches have superseded these native craft 
which are fast disappearing from the smooth 
waters of Kiangsu province very much as the 
fast sailing ships, known as Baltimore Clippers, 
that in the fifties and sixties were engaged in the 
East India and China trade, have been gradually 
swept from the ocean by steam. 

At the end of three days, I was landed in the 
historic city of Hangchau, which is the capital 
of Chehkiang. It is situated on a plain of un- 
even ground, with hills in the southwest and west, 
and northeast. It covers an area of about three 
or four square miles. It is of a rectangular shape, 
Its length is from north to south; its breadth, 
from east to west. On the west, lies the Si-Hoo 
or West Lake, a beautiful sheet of limpid 
water with a gravelly or sandy bottom, stretch- 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 81 

ing from the foot of the city wall to the foot of 
the mountains which appear in the distance in 
the rear, rising into the clouds like lofty bul- 
warks guarding the city on the north. 

The Tsientang River, about two miles distant, 
flanks the city on the east. It takes its rise from 
the high mountain range of Hwui Chow in the 
southeast and follows a somewhat irregular 
course to the bay of the same name, and rushes 
down the rocky declivities like a foaming steed 
and empties itself into the bay about forty miles 
east of the city. This is one of the rivers that 
have periodical bores in which the tidal waters in 
their entrance to the bay create a noise like thun- 
der, and the waves rise to the height of eight or 
ten feet. 

Hangchau, aside from her historic fame as 
having been the .seat of the government of the 
Sung Dynasty of the 12th and 13th centuries, 
has always maintained a wide reputation for fine 
buildings, public and private, such as temples, 
pagodas, mosques and bridges, which go to lend 
enchantment to the magnificent natural scenery 
with which she is singularly endowed. But 
latterly, age and the degeneration of the times 
have done their work of mischief. Her past glory 
is fast sinking into obscurity; she will never 



82 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

recover her former prestige, unless a new 
power arises to make her once more the capital 
of a regenerated government. 

On the 15th of March, I left Hangchau to 
ascend the Tsientang River, at a station called 
Kang Kow, or mouth of the river, ahout two 
miles east of the city, where boats were waiting 
for us. Several hundreds of these boats of a 
peculiar and unique type were riding near the 
estuary of the river. These boats are called Urh 
Woo, named after the district where they were 
built. They vary from fifty to one hundred feet 
in length, from stem to stern, and are ten or 
fifteen feet broad, and draw not more than two 
or three feet of water when fully loaded. They 
are all flat-bottom boats, built of the most limber 
and flexible material that can be found, as they 
are expected to meet strong currents and run 
against rocks, both in their ascent and descent, 
on account of the irregularity and rocky bottom 
of the river* These boats, when completely 
equipped and covered with bamboo matting, look 
like huge cylinders, and are shaped like cigars. 
The interior from stem to stern is divided into 
separate compartments, or rooms, in which 
bunks are built to accommodate passengers. 
These compartments and bunks are removed 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 83 

when room is needed for cargoes. These boats 
ply between Hangehau and Sheong Shan and 
do all the interior transportation by water be- 
tween these entrepots in Chehkiang and KiangsL 
Sheong Shan is the important station of Cheh- 
kiang, and Yuh-Shan is that of Kiangsl The 
distance between the two entrepots is about fifty 
lis, or about sixteen English miles, connected 
by one of the finest macadamized roads in China. 
The road is about thirty feet wide, paved with 
slabs of granite and flanked with greenish-colored 
cobbles. A fine stone arch which was erected as 
a land-mark of the boundary line separating 
Chehkiang and Kiangsi provinces, spans the 
whole width of the road. On both sides of the 
key-stone of the arch are carved four fine Chinese 
characters, painted in bright blue, viz., Leang 
Hsing Tung Chu: 



This is one of the most notable arch-ways 
through which the inter-provincial trade has been 
carried on for ages past. At the time when I 
crossed from Sheong Shan to Yuh-Shan, the 
river ports of Hankau, Kiukiang, Wuhu and 
Chinkiang were not opened to foreign trade 



8* MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and steam-boats had not come in to play their 
part in the carrying trade of the interior of 
China. This magnificent thoroughfare was 
crowded with thousands of porters bearing mer- 
chandise of all kinds to and fro exports and 
imports for distribution. It certainly presented 
an interesting sight to the traveller, as well as 
a profound topic of contemplation to a Chinese 
patriot. 

The opening of the Yangtze River, which is 
navigable as far as Kingchau, on the borders of 
Szechwan province, commanding the trade of at 
least six or seven provinces along its whole 
course of nearly three thousand miles to the 
ocean, presents a spectacle of unbounded possi- 
bilities for the amelioration of nearly a third of 
the human race, if only the grasping ambition of 
the West will let the territorial integrity and 
the independent sovereignty of China remain 
intact. Give the people of China a fair chance 
to work out the problems of their own salvation, 
as for instance the solution of the labor question, 
which has been so radically disorganized and 
broken up by steam, electricity and machinery. 
This has virtually taken the breath and bread 
away from nine-tenths of the people of China, 
and therefore this immovable mass of population 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 85 

should be given ample time to recover from its 
demoralization. 

To go back to my starting point at Kang 
Ivow, the entrance to the river, two miles east of 
Hangchau, we set sail, with a fair wind, at five 
o'clock in the morning of the 15th of March, 
and in the evening at ten o'clock we anchored 
at a place named the "Seven Dragons," after 
having made about one hundred miles during 
the day* The eastern shore in this part of the 
Tsientang River is evidently of red sandstone 
formation, for we could see part of the strata 
submerged in the water, and excavations of the 
stone may be seen strewn about on the shore. In 
fact, red sandstone buildings may be seen scat- 
tered about here and there. But the mountain 
about the Seven Dragons is picturesque and 
romantic. 

Early the next day, we again started, but the 
rain poured down in torrents. We kept on till 
we reached the town of Lan Chi and came to 
anchor in the evening, after having made about 
forty miles. This is the favorite entrepot where 
the Hupeh and Hunan congou teas were 
brought all the way from the tea districts of these 
provinces, to be housed and transhipped to 
Shanghai via Hangchau. Lan Chi is an 



86 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

entrepot of only one street, but Its entire length 
is six miles. It is famous for its nice hams, which 
are known all over China. On account of the 
incessant rain, we stopped half a day at Lan 
Chi. In the afternoon the sky began to clear 
and at twelve o'clock in the night we again 
started and reached the walled city of Ku Chow, 
which was besieged by the Taiping rebels in 
March, 1858, just a year before; after four 
months* duration the siege was raised and no 
great damage was done. We put up in an inn 
for the night. Ku Chow is a departmental city 
of Chehkiang and is about thirty miles distant 
from Sheong Shan, already mentioned in con- 
nection with Yuh-Shan. We were delayed by 
the Custom House officials, as well as on account 
of the scarcity of porters and chair-bearers to 
take us over to Sheong Shan. We arrived at 
Yuh-Shan from Sheong Shan by chair in the 
evening. We put up in an inn for the night, 
having first engaged fishing boats to take us to 
the city of Kwangshun, thirty miles from Yuh- 
Shan, the next morning. After reaching Yuh- 
Shan, we were in Kiangsi territory, and our 
route now lay in a west by north direction, down 
stream towards the Po Yang Lake, whose south- 
ern margin we passed, and reached Nan Cheong, 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 87 

the capital of Kiangsi province. The city pre- 
sented a fine outward appearance. We did not 
stop long enough to go through the city and see 
its actual condition since its evacuation by the 
rebels* 

Our route from Nan Cheong was changed in 
a west by south direction, making the great 
entrepot of Siang Tan our final goal. In this 
route, we passed quite a number of large cities 
that had nothing of special importance, either 
commercially or historically, to relate. We 
passed Cheong Sha, the capital of Hunan, in 
the night. We arrived at Siang Tan on the 
morning of the 15th of April. Siang Tan is one 
of the noted entrepots in the interior of China 
and used to be the great distributing center of 
imports when foreign trade was confined to the 
single port of Canton. It was also the emporium 
where the tea and silk goods of China were 
centered and housed, to be carried down to 
Canton for exportation to foreign countries. 
The overland transport trade between Siang 
Tan and Canton was immense. It gave employ- 
ment to at least one hundred thousand porters, 
carrying merchandise over the Nan Fung pass, 
between the two cities, and supported a large 
population along both sides of the thoroughfare. 



88 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Steam, wars and treaties of very recent dates 
have not only broken up this system of labor 
and changed the complexion of the whole labor 
question throughout China, but will also alter 
the economical, industrial and political condi- 
tions of the Chinese Empire during the coming 
years of her history. 

At Siang Tan, our whole party, composed of 
tea-men, was broken up and each batch began 
its journey to the district assigned it, to begin 
the work of purchasing raw tea and preparing it 
to be packed for shipment in Shanghai. 

I stayed in Siang Tan about ten days and 
then made preparations for a trip up to the 
department of Kingchau in Hupeh province, to 
look into the yellow silk produced in a district 
called Ho- Yung. 

We left Siang Tan on the 26th of April, and 
proceeded northward to our place of destination. 
Next morning at eight o'clock we reached 
Cheong Sha, the capital of Hunan province. As 
the day was wet and gloomy, we stopped and 
tried to make the best of it by going inside of the 
city to see whether there was anything worth 
seeing, but like all Chinese cities, it presented 
the same monotonous appearance of age and 
filth, the same unchangeable style of architecture 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 89 

and narrow streets* Early next morning, we 
resumed our boat journey, crossed the Tung 
Ting Lake and the great river Yangtze till we 
entered the mouth of the King Ho which carried 
us to Ho Yung. On this trip to hunt after the 
yellow silk not the golden fleece we were 
thirteen days from Siang Tan. The country on 
both banks of the King Ho seemed quiet and 
peaceful and people were engaged in agricul- 
tural pursuits. We saw many buffaloes and 
donkeys, and large patches of wheat, inter- 
spersed with beans. A novel sight presented 
itself which I have never met with elsewhere in 
China. A couple of country lassies were riding 
on a donkey, and were evidently in a happy 
mood, laughing and talking as they rode by. 
Arriving in Ho Yung, we had some difficulty in 
finding an inn, but finally succeeded in securing 
quarters in a silk hong. No sooner were we 
safely quartered, than a couple of native con- 
stables called to know who we were; our names 
and business were taken down. Our host, the 
proprietor of the hong, who knew the reason 
of our coming, explained things to the satisfac- 
tion of the men, who went away perfectly 
satisfied that we were honest traders and no 
rebel spies. We were left to transact our busi- 



90 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

ness unmolested* As soon as our object was 
known, numerous samples of yellow silk were 
brought for our inspection. We selected quite 
a number of samples, which altogether weighed 
about sixty-five pounds, and had them packed 
to be taken to Shanghai. 

At the end of a fortnight, we concluded to take 
our journey back. Accordingly, on the 26th of 
May we bade Ho Yung farewell, and started 
for the tea district of Mh Kia Shi, in the 
department of Oheong Sha, via Hankau. We 
arrived at Hankau on the 5th of June, and put 
up in a native inn. The weather was hot and 
muggy, and our quarters were narrow and cut 
off from fresh air. Three days after our arrival, 
three deputies visited us to find out who we were. 
It did not take long to convince them that we 
were not rebel spies. We showed them the 
package of yellow silk, which bore marks of a 
war-tax which we had to pay on it, all along the 
route from Ho Yung to Hankau. We were 
left unmolested. 

The port of Hankau had not been opened for 
foreign trade, though it was well understood 
that it was to be opened very soon. Before its 
capture by the Taiping rebels, or rather before 
the Taiping rebels had made their appearance 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 91 

on the stage of action, Hankau was the most 
important entrepot in China. When the 
Taiping rebels captured Woochang in 1856, 
Hankau and Han Yang fell at the same time, 
and the port was destroyed by fire and was 
reduced to ashes. At the time of my visit, the 
whole place was rebuilt and trade began to 
revive. But the buildings were temporary 
shifts, Now the character of the place is com- 
pletely changed and the foreign residences and 
warehouses along the water's edge have given 
it altogether a European aspect, so that the 
Hankau of today may be regarded as the 
Chicago or St. Louis of China, and in no distant 
day she is destined to surpass both in trade, 
population and wealth. I was in Hankau a few 
days before I crossed the Yangtze-Kiang to the 
black tea district of Nih Kia Shi. 

We left Hankau on the 30th of June and 
went over to the tea packing houses in Nih Kia 
Shi and Yang Liu Tung on the 4th of July. I 
was in those two places over a month and gained 
a complete knowledge of the whole process of 
preparing the black tea for the foreign market. 
The process is very simple and can be easily 
learned. I do not know through what prepara- 
tions the Indian and Assam teas have to 



92 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

go, where machinery Is used, but they cannot 
be very elaborate. Undoubtedly, since the 
fifties, manual labor, the old standby in pre- 
paring teas for foreign consumption, has been 
much improved with a view of retaining a large 
percentage of the tea trade in China. The 
reason why a large percentage of the tea busi- 
ness has passed away from China to India is not 
because machinery is used in the one case and 
manual labor is retained in the other, but chiefly 
on account of the quality of the tea that is raised 
in the different soil of the two countries. The 
Indian or Assam tea is much stronger (in 
proportion to the same quantity) than the 
Chinese tea. The Indian tea is 2-1 to Chinese 
tea, in point of strength, whereas the Chinese 
ta is 2-1 to the Indian tea in point of 
delicacy and flavor. The Indian is rank and 
strong, but the Chinese tea is superior in the 
quality of its fine aroma. The higher class of 
tea-drinkers in America, Europe and Russia 
prefer China tea to Indian, whereas the laboring 
and common class in those countries take to 
Indian and Assam, from the fact that they are 
stronger and cheaper. 

In the latter part of August I decided to 
return to Shanghai, not by way of Siang Tan, 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 93 

but via Hankau, down the Yangtze River to 
Kiu Kang and across the Poh Yang Lake* I 
arrived at Hankau again the second time on the 
29th of August, having left there two months 
previous, in July. This time I came in a Hunan 
junk loaded with tea for Shanghai. At Ho 
Kow, the southern shore of the Poh Yang Lake, 
I had to follow the same route I took in March, 
and on the 21st of September I landed at Hang- 
chau and from there I took a Woo-Sik-Kwei 
for Shanghai, where I arrived in the night 
of the 30th of September, the time consumed 
on this journey having been seven months 
from March to October. It was my first journey 
into the interior of China, <and it gave me a 
chance to gain an insight into the actual condition 
of the people, while a drastic rebellion was going 
on in their midst. The zone of the country 
through which I had passed had been visited by 
the rebels and the imperialists, but was, to all out- 
ward appearance, peaceful and quiet. To what 
extent the people had suffered both from rebel 
and imperialist devastations in those sections of 
the country, no one can tell. But there was one 
significant fact that struck me forcibly and that 
was the sparseness of population, which was at 
variance with my preconceived notions regarding 



94 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the density of population in China which I had 
gathered from books and accounts of travelers. 
This was particularly noticeable through that 
section of Chehkiang, Kiangsi, Hunan and 
Hupeh, which I visited. The time of the year, 
when crops of all kinds needed to be planted, 
should have brought out the peasantry into the 
open fields with oxen, mules, donkeys, buffaloes 
and horses, as indispensable accessories to farm 
life. But comparatively few farmers were met 
with. 

Shortly after my arrival from the interior, in 
October, an English friend of mine requested 
me to go to Shau Hing to buy raw silk for him. 
Shau Hing is a city located in a silk district 
about twenty miles southwest of Hangchau, and 
noted for its fine quality of silk. I was about 
two months in this business, when I was taken 
down with fever and ague and was compelled 
to give it up. Shau Hing, like most Chinese 
cities, was filthy and unhealthy and the water 
that flowed through it was as black as ink. The 
city was built in the lowest depression of a valley, 
and the outlet of the river was so blocked that 
there was hardly any current to carry off the 
filth that had been accumulating for ages. 
Hence the city was literally located in a cess- 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 95 

pool a breeding place for fever and ague, and 
epidemics of all kinds. But I soon recovered 
from the attack of the fever and ague and as 
soon as I could stand on my legs again, I imme- 
diately left the malarial atmosphere, and was, 
in a short time, breathing fresher and purer air. 



CHAPTER X 
MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 

In the fall of 1859 a small party of two 
missionaries, accompanied by Tsang Laisun, 
planned a trip to visit the Taiping rebels in 
Nanking. I was asked to join them, and I 
decided to do so. My object in going was to 
find out for my own satisfaction the character 
of the Taipings; whether or not they were the 
men fitted to set up a new government in the 
place of the Manchu Dynasty. Accordingly, on 
the 6th of November, 1859, we left Shanghai in 
a Woo-Sik-Kwei boat, with a stiff northeast 
breeze in our favor, though we had to stem an 
ebb tide for an hour. The weather was fine and 
the whole party was in fine spirits. We 
happened to have an American flag on board, 
and on the spur of the moment, it was flung to 
the breeze, but on a sober second thought, we had 
it hauled down so as not to attract undue atten- 
tion and have it become the means of thwarting 
the purpose of our journey. Instead of taking 

the Sung-Kiang route which was the highway 

96 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 97 

to Suchau, we turned off into another one in 
order to avoid the possibility of being hauled 
up by the imperialists and sent back to Shang- 
hai, as we were told that an imperial fleet of 
Chinese gun-boats was at anchor at Sung 
Kiang. We found the surrounding country 
within a radius of thirty miles of Shanghai to be 
very quiet and saw no signs of political dis- 
turbance. The farmers were busily engaged in 
gathering in their rice crops. 

It might be well to mention here that during 
my sojourn in the interior, the Taiping rebels 
had captured the city of Suchau, and there was 
some apprehension on the part of foreigners in 
the settlement that they might swoop down to 
take possession of the city of Shanghai, as well 
as the foreign settlement. That was the reason 
the Sung Kiang River was picketed by Chinese 
gun-boats, and the foreign pickets were extended 
miles beyond the boundary line of the foreign 
concession. 

We reached Suchau on the morning of the 9th 
of November without meeting with any difficulty 
or obstacles all the way, nor were we challenged 
either by the imperialists or rebels, which went 
to show how loosely and negligently even in 
time of war, things were conducted in China. 



98 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

On arriving at the Lau Gate of the city, we had 
to wait at the station where tickets were issued 
to those who went into the city and taken from 
those who left, for Suchau was then under mar- 
tial law. As we wished to go into the city to see 
the commandant, in order to get letters of intro- 
duction from him to the chiefs of other cities 
along our route to Nanking, we had to send two 
of our party to headquarters to find out whether 
we were permitted to enter. At the station, close 
to the Lau Gate, we waited over an hour. 
Finally our party appeared accompanied by the 
same messenger who had been deputed by the 
head of the police to accompany them to the 
commandant's office. Permission was given us, 
and all four went in. The civil officer was 
absent, but we were introduced to the military 
commandant, Liu. He was a tall man, dressed 
in red. His affected hauteur at the start was too 
thin to disguise his want of a solid character. 
He became very inquisitive and asked the object 
of our journey to Nanking, He treated us very 
kindly, however, and gave us a letter of intro- 
duction to the commandant in Tan Yang, and 
furnished us with passports all the way through 
the cities of Woo Sik and Cheong Chow. In the 
audience hall of Commandant Liu, we were 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 99 

introduced to four foreigners two Americans, 
one Englishman, and a French noble. One of 
the Americans said he was a doctor, the English- 
man was supposed to be a military officer, and 
the Frenchman, as stated above, claimed to be 
a nobleman. Doubtless they were all ad- 
venturers. Each had his own ax to grind. One 
of the Americans had a rifle and cartridges for 
sale. He asked quite an exorbitant price for 
them and they were summarily rejected. The 
Frenchman said he had lost a fortune and had 
come out to China to make it up. Our mission- 
ary companions were much pleased after being 
entertained by Liu in hearing him recite the 
doxology, which he did glibly. Towards 
evening, when we returned to our boat, he sent 
us a number of chickens and a goat to boot. We 
were thus amply provisioned to prosecute our 
journey to Tan Yang. We left Suchau on the 
morning of the llth of November. On our 
arrival at Woo Sik, our passports were examined 
and we were very courteously treated by the 
rebels. We were invited to dinner by the chief 
in command. After that he sent us fruits and 
nuts, and came on board himself to see us off. 
We held quite a long conversation with him, 
which ended in his repeating the doxology. 



100 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

November 12th we left Woo Sik and started 
for Cheong Chow, From Suchau onward we 
were on the Grand Canal. The road on the 
bank of the canal was in good condition. Most 
of the people we saw and met were rebels, travel- 
ing between Tan Yang and Suchau, and but few 
boats were seen passing each other. All the 
country surrounding the canal between those 
cities seemed to have been abandoned by the 
peasantry and the cultivated fields were covered 
with rank grass and weeds, instead of flourishing 
crops. A traveler, not knowing the circum- 
stances, would naturally lay the blame wholly 
upon the Taiping rebels, but the imperialists 
in their conflicts with the rebels, were as culpable 
as their enemies. The rebels whom we met on 
the public road were generally very civil and 
tried in every way to protect the people in order 
to gain their confidence. Incendiarism, pillage, 
robbery and ill-treatment of the people by the 
rebels, were punished by death. We reached 
Cheong Chow in the night. We found nearly all 
the houses along the road between Woo Sik and 
Cheong Chow to be completely deserted and 
emptied of all their inmates. There were occa- 
sionally a few of the inhabitants to be seen 
standing on the bank with small baskets, 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 101 

peddling eggs, oranges and cakes, vegetables 
and pork. They were principally old people, 
with countenances showing their suffering and 
despair. On November 13, at six o'clock in the 
morning, we resumed our journey to Tan Yang. 
As we drew near Tan Yang, the people 
seemed to have regained their confidence and the 
fields seemed to be cultivated. The conduct of 
the rebels towards them was considerate and 
commendable. During the morning we saw a 
force of one thousand men marching towards 
Tan Yang. We did not quite reach Tan Yang 
and came to anchor for the night in plain sight 
of it. 

Early next morning, we went into the city to 
see the Commandant Liu, to present to him the 
letter we received in Suchau, but he was absent 
from the city. The man next to Liu, a civilian, 
came out to meet us. He was very affable and 
treated us kindly and with great civility. One 
of our party referred to the religious character 
of the Taipings. 

Chin then gave us his views of Christianity, 
as taught by Hung Siu Chune the leader of 
the rebellion. He said: 

"We worship God the Heavenly Father, with 
whom Jesus and the Holy Spirit constitute the 



102 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

true God; that Shang Ti is the True Spirit." 
He then repeated the doxology. He said the 
rebels had two doxologies the old and the new; 
they had discarded the new and adopted the old. 
He said, the Tien Wong the Celestial Emper- 
or was taken up to Heaven and received orders 
from the Heavenly Father to come and exter- 
minate all evil and rectify all wrong; to destroy 
idolatry and evil spirits, and finally to teach the 
people the knowledge of God. He did not know 
whether the Tien Wong was translated to 
Heaven hodily or in spirit, or both. He said the 
Tien Wong himself explained that he could not 
hold the same footing with God himself; that 
the homage paid to God was an act of religious 
worship, but that rendered to the Tien Wong 
was merely an act of court etiquette, which 
ministers and officers always paid to their sov- 
ereigns in every dynasty, and could not be 
construed as acts of worship. He also said that 
Tien Wong was a younger brother of Christ, but 
that it did not follow that he was born of the 
same mother. Tien Wong, he claimed, was a 
younger brother of Christ in the sense that he 
was especially appointed by God to instruct the 
people. Christ was also appointed by God to 
reform and redeem the world. With regard to 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 103 

the three cups of tea, he said that they were 
Intended as a thank-offering, and were not pro- 
pitiatory in their character. 

"Whenever we drink a cup of tea, we offer 
thanksgiving to the Heavenly Father. The 
three cups of tea have no reference to the Trinity 
whatever. One cup answers the same purpose. 
The number three was purposely chosen, because 
it is the favorite number with the Chinese, it is 
even mentioned in the Chinese classics." 

As for redemption, he said, "No sacrificial 
offering can take away our sins; the power of 
redemption is in Christ ; he redeems us and it is 
our duty to repent of our sins. Even the Tien 
Wong is very circumspect and is afraid to sin 
against God." 

In the matter of the soldiery keeping aloof 
from the people in time of war, he said, "It 
has been an immemorial custom, adopted by 
almost every dynasty, that the people should go 
to the country, and the soldiers be quartered in 
the city. When a city is captured or taken, it is 
easy to subjugate the surrounding country." 

The places we saw in ruins, both at Suchau 
and all the way up the canal, were partly de- 
stroyed by Cheong Yuh Leang's troops in their 
retreat, partly by local predatory parties for the 



104 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

sake of plunder, and partly by the Taipings 
themselves. When Chung Wong was in 
Suehau, he did all he could to suppress incen- 
diarism hy offering rewards of both money and 
rank to those who took an active part in sup- 
pressing it. He issued three orders: 1. That 
soldiers were not allowed to kill or slaughter the 
inhabitants. 2. They were prohibited from 
slaughtering cattle. 3* They were prohibited 
from setting fire to houses. A violation of any 
of these orders was attended with capital pun- 
ishment. When he came down to Woo Sik, he 
had a country elder decapitated for allowing 
local bandits to burn down the houses of the 
people. This was the information we gathered 
from our conversation with Chin. He also said 
that Ying Wong and Chung Wong were both 
talented men not only in military but also in 
civil affairs. 

He gave us a long account of the capture of 
different places by the rebels, and how they had 
been defeated before Nanking, when that city 
was laid siege to by the imperialists in the early 
part of 1860. He also showed us a letter by a 
chief at Hwui Chow regarding the utter defeat 
and rout of Tsang Kwoh Fan, who was hemmed 
in by an immense force of the rebels. Tsang 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 105 

was supposed to have been killed in the great 
battle. He said that Cheong Yuh Leang, the 
imperialist general, who laid siege to Nanking, 
after his defeat went to Hangchau for medical 
treatment for hemorrhage of the lungs; that all 
the country along the canal, north of the 
Yangtze, was in the hands of the rebels, and that 
Princes Chung and Ying were marching up the 
river to take possession of Hupeh, and that Shih 
Ta Kai, another chief, was assigned the conquest 
of Yun Nan, Kwai Chow and Sze Chune prov- 
inces. At that time Chin Kiang was being 
besieged by the rebels, and Chi Wong was in 
command of an army of observation in Kiang 
Nan. Such was the rambling statement given 
us by Chin regarding the disposition of the rebel 
forces under different chiefs or princes. 

After dining with him in the evening, we 
repaired to our boat for the night. The next 
morning, November 15th, we again went into the 
city and called upon Liu, but, failing to see him, 
we again called upon Chin to arrange for the 
conveyance of our luggage and ourselves from 
Tan Yang to Nanking. The aide told us to 
send all our things to Chin's office and that our 
boat, if left in Tan Yang until our return, would 
be well cared for and protected during our 



106 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

absence. So next morning, the 16th of Novem- 
ber, we started on foot and walked fifteen miles 
from Tan Yang to a village called Po Ying, 
about six miles from the city of Ku Yung, 
where we halted to pass the night. We had 
some difficulty in securing a resting place. The 
people were poor and had no confidence in 
strangers. We, however, after some coaxing, 
were supplied with straws spread out on the 
ground, and the next morning we gave the old 
women a dollar. We had boiled rice gruel, cold 
chicken and crackers for our breakfast. When 
we reached Ku Yung about nine o'clock on the 
17th of November, we found that every gate of 
the city was closed against us, as well as all 
others, because a rumor was afloat that the rebels 
before Chin Kiang were defeated, and that they 
were flocking towards Ku Yung for shelter. 
So we concluded to continue on our journey 
towards Nanking, though our missionary friends 
came near deciding to return to Tan Yang and 
wend our way back to Shanghai. We proceeded 
not far from Ku Yung, when we finally suc- 
ceeded in getting chairs and mules to prosecute 
our journey. 

On the 18th of November, after a trying and 
wearisome journey, we reached Nanking. I 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 107 

was the first one to reach the South Gate, waiting 
for the rest of the party to come up before enter- 
ing. We were reported inside of the gate and 
messengers accompanied us to the headquarters 
of the Rev. Mr. Roberts, close by the headquar- 
ters of Hung Jin, styled Prince Kan. 

After our preliminary introduction to the 
Rev. Mr. Roberts, I excused myself, and leaving 
the rest of the party to continue their conversa- 
tion with him, retired to my quarters to clean up 
and get nested from the long and tedious 
journey. In fact, I had little or nothing to say 
while in Mr. Roberts' presence, nor did I 
attempt to make myself known to him. I had 
seen him often in Macao when in Mrs. GutzlafPs 
school, twenty or more years before, and I had 
recognized him at once as soon as I set my eyes 
on him. He certainly appeared old to me, being 
dressed in his yellow satin robe of state and 
moving leisurely in his clumsy Chinese shoes. 
Exactly in what capacity he was acting in 
Nanking, I was at a loss to know; whether still 
as a religious adviser to Hung Siu Chune, 
or playing the part of secretary of state for 
the Taiping Dynasty, no one seemed able to 
teU. 

The next day (the 19th of November) I was 



108 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

invited to call on Kan Wong. He was 
a nephew of Hung Siu Chune, the rebel chief 
who was styled Tien Wong or the Celestial 
Sovereign, Before Hung Jin came to Nanking, 
I had made his acquaintance, in 1856, at Hong 
Kong* He was then connected with the London 
Mission Association as a native preacher and 
was under Dr, James Legge, the distinguished 
translator of the Chinese classics. I saw consid- 
erable of him while in Hong Kong and even 
then he had expressed a wish that he might 
see me some day in Nanking. He was then 
called Hung Jin, but since he had joined 
his uncle in Nanking, he was raised to the 
position of a prince. Kan means "Protecting," 
and Kan Wong signifies "Protecting Prince." 
He greeted me very cordially and evidently was 
glad to see me. After the usual exchange of 
conventionalities, he wanted to know what I 
thought of the Taipings ; whether I thought well 
enough of their cause to identify myself with it. 
In reply, I said I had no intention of casting 
my lot with them, but came simply to see him 
and pay my respects. At the same time, I 
wanted to find out for my own satisfaction the 
actual condition of things in Nanking. I said 
the journey from Suchau to Nanking had sug- 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 109 

gested several things to me, which I thought 
might be of interest to him. They were as 
follows: 

1. To organize an army on scientific 
principles. 

2. To establish a military school for the 
training of competent military officers. 

3. To establish a naval school for a navy. 

4. To organize a civil government with able 
and experienced men to act as advisers in 
the different departments of adminis- 
tration. 

5. To establish a banking system, and to 
determine on a standard of weight and 
measure. 

6. To establish an educational system of 
graded schools for the people, making the 
Bible one of the text books. 

7. To organize a system of industrial 
schools. 

These were the topics that suggested them- 
selves to me during the journey* If the Taiping 
government would be willing, I said, to adopt 
these measures and set to work to make suitable 
appropriations for them, I would be perfectly 
willing to offer my services to help carry them 
out. It was in that capacity that I felt I could 



110 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

be of the most service to the Taiping cause. In 
any other, I would simply be an encumbrance 
and a hindrance to them. 

Such was the outcome of my first interview. 
Two days later, I was again invited to call. In 
the second interview, we discussed the merits and 
the importance of the seven proposals stated in 
our first interview. Kan Wong, who had seen 
more of the outside world than the other princes 
or leaders, and even more than Hung Siu Chune 
himself, knew wherein lay the secret of the 
strength and power of the British government 
and other European powers, and fully appre- 
ciated the paramount importance and bearing 
of these proposals. But he was alone and had 
no one to back him in advocating them. The 
other princes, or leaders, were absent from the 
city, carrying on their campaign against the 
imperialists. He said he was well aware of the 
importance of these measures, but nothing could 
be done until they returned, as it required the 
consent of the majority to any measure before 
it could be carried out. 

A few days after this a small parcel was pre- 
sented to me as coming from Kan Wong. On 
opening it, I found to my great surprise a wooden 
seal about four inches long and an inch wide, 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 111 
having my name carved with the title of "E," 



which means "Righteousness," and designates 
the fourth official rank under that of a prince, 
which is the first. My title was written out on a 
piece of yellow satin stamped with the official 
seal of the Kan Wong. I was placed in a quan- 
dary and was at a loss to know its purport, 
whether it was intended to detain me in Nanking 
for good or to commit me irretrievably to the 
Taiping cause, nolens volens. At all events, I 
had not been consulted in the matter and Kan 
Wong had evidently acted on his own responsi- 
bility and taken it for granted that by conferring 
on me such a high rank as the fourth in the 
official scale of the Taipings, I might be induced 
to accept and thus identify myself with the 
Taiping cause of the final success of which I had 
strong doubts, judging from the conduct, char- 
acter and policy of the leading men connected 
with it, I talked the matter over with my asso- 
ciates, and came to the decision that I must 
forthwith return the seal and decline the tempt- 
ing bauble. I went in person to thank Kan 
Wong for this distinguished mark of his high 
consideration, and told him that at any time 



112 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

when the leaders of the Taipings decided to 
carry out either one or all of my suggestions, 
made in my first interview with him, I should 
be most happy to serve them, if my services were 
needed to help in the matter. I then asked him 
as a special favor for a passport that would*guar- 
antee me a safe conduct in traveling through the 
territory under the jurisdiction of the Taipings, 
whether on business or pleasure. The passport 
was issued to me the next day, on the 24th of 
December, and we were furnished with proper 
conveyances and provisions to take us back to 
the city of Tan Yang, where our boat lay under 
the protection of Chin, second in command of 
the city, waiting our return from Nanking. We 
started on our return trip for Shanghai on the 
27th of December by the same route as we came, 
and arrived safely in Tan Yang in the early part 
of January, 1861. 

On my way back to Shanghai, I had ample 
time to form an estimate of the Taiping Rebel- 
lion its origin, character and significance. 



CHAPTER XI 

REFLECTIONS ON THE TAIPING 
REBELLION 

Rebellions and revolutions in China are not 
new and rare historic occurrences. There have 
been at least twenty-four dynasties and as many 
attendant rebellions or revolutions. But with 
the exception of the Feudatory period, revolu- 
tions in China (since the consolidation of the 
three Kingdoms into one Empire under the 
Emperor Chin) meant only a change of hands 
in the government, without a change either of 
its form, or principles. Hence the history of 
China for at least two thousand years, like her 
civilization, bears the national impress of a 
monotonous dead level jejune in character, 
wanting in versatility of genius, and almost 
devoid of historic inspiration. 

The Taiping Rebellion differs from its pre- 
decessors in that in its embryo stage it had taken 
onto itself the religious element, which became 
the vital force that carried it from the defiles 
and wilds of Kwangsi province in the southwest 
to the city of Nanking in the northeast, and 

made it for a period of fifteen years a constantly 

113 



114 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

impending danger to the Mancfau Dynasty, 
whose corruption, weakness and maladministra- 
tion were the main causes that evoked the 
existence of this great rebellion. 

The religious element that gave it life and 
character was a foreign product, introduced into 
China hy the early Protestant missionaries, of 
whom Dr. Robert Morrison was the first Eng- 
lish pioneer sent out by the London Mission, 
followed a decade later by the Rev. Icabod J. 
Roberts, an American missionary. These two 
missionaries may properly claim the credit, if 
there is any, of having contributed (each in his 
particular sphere) in imparting to Hung Siu 
Chune a knowledge of Christianity. Dr. Morri- 
son, on his part, had translated the Bible into 
Chinese, and the Emperor Khang Hsi's dic- 
tionary into English; both these achievements 
gave the missionary work in China a basis to go 
upon in prosecuting the work of revising and of 
bringing the Bible to the Chinese standard of 
literary taste, so as to commend it to the literary 
classes, and in making further improvements in 
perfecting the Chinese-English dictionary, which 
was subsequently done by such men as Dr. Med- 
hurst, Bishop Boone, Dr. Legge, E. C. Bridge- 
man, and S. Wells Williams. 



REFLECTIONS ON TAIPING REBELLION 115 

Besides these works of translation, which un- 
doubtedly called for further revision and im- 
provement, Dr. Morrison also gave China a 
native convert Leang Ahfah who became 
afterwards a noted preacher and the author of 
some religious tracts. 

Hung Siu Chune, in his quest after religious 
knowledge and truths, got hold of a copy of Dr. 
Morrison's Bible and the tracts of Leang Ahfah, 
He read and studied them, but he stood in need 
of a teacher to explain to him many points in 
the Bible, which appeared to him mysterious and 
obscure. He finally made the acquaintance of 
the Rev. Mr. Icabod J. Roberts, an American 
missionary from Missouri, who happened to 
make his headquarters in Canton. Hung Siu 
Chune called upon him often, till their acquaint- 
ance ripened into a close and lasting friendship, 
which was kept up till Hung Siu Chune suc- 
ceeded in taking Nanking, when Mr. Roberts 
was invited to reside there in the double capacity 
of a religious teacher and a state adviser. This 
was undoubtedly done in recognition of Mr. 
Roberts' services as Hung's teacher and friend 
while in Canton. No one knew what had become 
of Mr. Roberts when Nanking fell and reverted 
to the imperialists in 1864. 



116 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

It was about this time, when he was sedulously 
seeking Mr. Roberts 5 religious instructions at 
Canton, that Hung failed to pass his first com- 
petitive examination as a candidate to compete 
for official appointment, and he decided to 
devote himself exclusively to the work of preach- 
ing the Gospel to his own people, the Hakkas 
of Kwang Tung and KwangsL But as a col- 
porter and native preacher, Hung had not 
reached the climax of his religious experience 
before taking up his stand as the leader of his 
people in open rebellion against the Manchu 
Dynasty. 

We must go back to the time when, as a 
candidate for the literary competitive examina- 
tions, he was disappointed. This threw him into 
a fever, and when he was tossing about in delir- 
ium, he was supposed to have been translated to 
Heaven, where he was commanded by the 
Almighty to fill and execute the divine mission 
of his life, which was to destroy idolatry, to 
rectify all wrong, to teach the people a knowledge 
of the true God, and to preach redemption 
through Christ. In view of such a mission, and 
being called to the presence of God, he at once 
assumed himself to be the son of God, co-equal 
with Christ, whom he called his elder brother. 



REFLECTIONS ON TAIPING REBELLION 117 

It was in such a state of mental hallucination 
that Hung Siu Chune appeared before his little 
congregation of Hakkas migrating strangers 
in the defiles and wilds of KwangsL Their 
novel and strange conduct as worshippers of 
Shangti the Supreme Ruler their daily reli- 
gious exercises, their prayers, and their chanting 
of the doxology as taught and enjoined by him, 
had attracted a widespread attention throughout 
all the surrounding region of KwangsL Every 
day fresh accessions of new comers flocked to 
their fold and swelled their ranks, till their 
numerical force grew so that the local mandarins 
were baffled and at their wits* end to know 
what to do with these believers of Christianity. 
Such, in brief, was the origin, growth and char- 
acter of the Christian element working among 
the simple and rustic mountaineers of Kwangsi 
and Kwang Tung. 

It is true that their knowledge of Christianity, 
as sifted through the medium of the early mis- 
sionaries from the West, and the native con- 
verts and colporters, was at best crude and 
elementary, but still they were truths of great 
power, potential enough to turn simple men and 
religiously-inclined women into heroes and 
heroines who faced dangers and death with the 



118 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

utmost indifference, as was seen subsequently, 
when the government had decided to take the 
bull by the horns and resorted to persecution as 
the final means to break up this religious, fanati- 
cal community. In their conflicts with the 
imperial forces, they had neither guns nor 
ammunition, but fought with broomsticks, flails 
and pitchforks. With these rustic and farming 
implements they drove the imperialist hordes 
before them as chaff and stubble before a 
hurricane. Such was their pent-up religious 
enthusiasm and burning ardor. 

Now this religious persecution was the side 
issue that had changed the resistance of Hung 
Siu Chime and his followers, in their religious 
capacity, into the character of a political 
rebellion. It is difficult to say whether or 
not, if persecution had not been resorted to, 
Hung Siu Chune and his followers would have 
remained peaceably in the heart of China and 
developed a religious community. We are in- 
clined to think, however, that even if there had 
been no persecution, a rebellion would have 
taken place, from the very nature of the political 
situation. 

Neither Christianity nor religious persecution 
was the immediate and logical cause of the 



REFLECTIONS OX TAIPING REBELLION 119 

rebellion of 1850. They might be taken as 
incidents or occasions that brought it about, but 
they were not the real causes of its existence. 
These may be found deeply seated in the vitals 
of the political constitution of the government. 
Foremost among them was the corruption of the 
the administrative government. The whole 
official organization, from head to foot, was 
honeycombed and tainted by a system of bribery, 
which passed under the polite and generic term 
of "presents," similar in character to what is now 
known as "graft." Next comes the exploitation 
of the people by the officials, who found an 
inexhaustible field to build up their fortunes. 
Finally comes the inevitable and logical corollary 
to official bribery and exploitation, namely, that 
the whole administrative government was found- 
ed on a gigantic system of fraud and falsehood. 

This rebellion rose in the arena of China 
with an enigmatic character like that of the 
Sphinx, somewhat puzzling at the start. The 
Christian world throughout the whole West, on 
learning of its Christian tendencies, such as the 
worship of the true and living God; Christ the 
Savior of the world; the Holy Spirit, the purifier 
of the soul; the destruction of temples and idols 
that was found wherever their victorious arms 



120 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

carried them; the uncompromising prohibition 
of th t e opium habit; the observance of a 
Sabbath; the offering of prayers before and 
after meals; the invocation of divine aid 
before a battle all these cardinal points 
of a Christian faith created a world-wide 
impression that China, through the instru- 
mentality of the Taipings, was to be evan- 
gelized; that the Manchu Dynasty was to be 
swept out of existence, and a "Celestial Empire 
of Universal Peace," as it was named by Hung 
Siu Chune, was going to be established, and thus 
China, by this wonderful intervention of a wise 
Providence, would be brought within the pale 
of Christian nations. But Christendom was a 
little too credulous and impulsive in the belief. 
It did not stop to have the Christianity of the 
Taipings pass through the crucible of a search- 
ing analysis. 

Their first victory over their persecutors 
undoubtedly gave Hung Siu Chune and his 
associates the first intimation of a possible over- 
turning of the Manchu Dynasty and the estab- 
lishment of a new one, which he named in 
his religious ecstasy "The Celestial Empire 
of Universal Peace." To the accomplishment of 
this great object, they bent the full force of 



REFLECTIONS ON TAIPING REBELLION 121 

their iconoclastic enthusiasm and religious zeal 
En route from Kwang Si, their starting point, 
to Nanking, victory had perched on their stan- 
dard all the way. They had despatched a division 
of their army to Peking, and, on its way to the 
northern capitol, it had met with a repulse and 
defeat at Tientsin from whence they had turned 
back to Nanking. In their victorious march 
through Hunan, Hupeh, Kiang Si and part of 
An Hwui, their depleted forces were replenished 
and reinforced by fresh and new accessions gath- 
ered from the people of those provinces. They 
were the riffraff and scum of their populations. 
This rabble element added no new strength to 
their fighting force, but proved to be an encum- 
brance and caused decided weakness. They knew 
no discipline, and had no restraining religious 
power to keep them from pillage, plunder and 
indiscriminate destruction. It was through such 
new accessions that the Taiping cause lost its 
prestige, and was defeated before Tientsin and 
forced to retreat to Nanking, After their defeat 
in the North, they began to decline in their 
religious character and their bravery. Their 
degeneracy was accelerated by the capture of 
Yang Chow, Suchau, and Hangchau, cities 
noted in Chinese history for their great wealth 



2 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 



as well as for their beautiful women. The cap- 
ture of these centers of a materialistic civilization 
poured into their laps untold wealth and luxury 
which tended to hasten their downfall. 

The Taiping Rebellion, after fifteen years of 
incessant and desultory fighting, collapsed and 
passed into oblivion, without leaving any traces of 
its career worthy of historical commemoration 
beyond the fact that it was the outburst of a 
religious fanaticism which held the Christian 
world in doubt and bewilderment, by reason of 
its Christian origin. It left no trace of its 
Christian element behind either in Nanking, 
where it sojourned for nearly ten years, or in 
Kwang Si, where it had its birth. In China, 
neither new political ideas nor political theories 
or principles were discovered which would have 
constituted the basal facts of a new form of 
government. So that neither in the religious nor 
yet in the political world was mankind in China 
or out of China benefited by that movement. 
The only good that resulted from the Taiping 
Rebellion was that God made use of it as a dy- 
namic power to break up the stagnancy of a great 
nation and wake up its consciousness for a new 
national life, as subsequent events in 1894, 1895, 
1898, 1900, 1901, and 1904-5 fully demonstrated. 



CHAPTER XII 

EXPEDITION TO THE TAIPING TEA 
DISTRICT 

My Nanking visit was utterly barren of any 
substantial hope of promoting any scheme of 
educational or political reform for the general 
welfare of China or for the advancement of my 
personal interest. When I was thoroughly con- 
vinced that neither the reformation nor the 
regeneration of China was to come from the Tai- 
pings, I at once turned my thoughts to the idea 
of making a big fortune as my first duty, and 
as the first element in the successful carrying out 
of other plans for the future. 

One day, while sauntering about in the tea 
garden inside the city of Shanghai, I came across 
a few tea-merchants regaling themselves with 
that beverage in a booth by themselves, evidently 
having a very social time. They beckoned to me 
to join their party. In the course of the conver- 
sation, we happened to touch on my late journey 
through the tea districts of Hunan, Hupeh and 
Kiang Si and also my trip to Nanking. Passing 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

from one topic of conversation to another, we 
lighted upon the subject of the green tea district 
of Taiping in An Hwui province. It was stated 
that an immense quantity of green tea could be 
found there, all packed and boxed ready for 
shipment, and that the rebels were in possession 
of the goods, and that whoever had the hardihood 
and courage to risk his life to gain possession of 
it would become a millionaire. I listened to the 
account with deep and absorbing interest, taking 
in everything that was said on the subject. It 
was stated that there were over 1,000,000 chests 
of tea there. Finally the party broke up, and 
I wended my way to my quarters completely 
absorbed in deep thought. I reasoned with 
myself that this was a chance for me to make a 
fortune, but wondered who would be foolhardy 
enough to furnish the capital, thinking that no 
business man of practical experience would risk 
his money in such a wild goose adventure, sur- 
rounded as it was with more than ordinary 
dangers and difficulties, in a country where 
highway robbery, lawlessness and murder were 
of daily occurrence. But with the glamor of a 
big fortune confronting me, all privations, 
dangers and risks of life seemed small and faded 
into airy nothing. 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 125 

My friend, Tsang Mew, who had been instru- 
mental in having me sent traveling into the 
interior a year before, was a man of great 
business experience. He had a long head and a 
large circle of business acquaintances, besides 
being my warm friend, so I concluded to go to 
him and talk over the whole matter, as I knew 
he would not hesitate to give me his best advice. 
I laid the whole subject before him. He said he 
would consider the matter fully and in a few 
days let me know what he had decided to do 
about it. After a few days, he told me that he 
had had several consultations with the head of 
the firm, of which he was comprador, and be- 
tween them the company had decided to take up 
my project. 

The plan of operation as mapped out by me 
was as follows: I was to go to the district of 
Taiping by the shortest and safest route possible, 
to find out whether the quantity of tea did exist; 
whether it was safe to have treasure taken up 
there to pay the rebels for the tea; and whether 
it was possible to have the tea supply taken down 
by native boats to be transhipped by steamer to 
Shanghai. This might be called the preliminary 
expedition. Then, I was to determine which of 
the two routes would be the more feasible, 



126 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

there being two, one by way of Wuhu, a treaty 
port, and another by way of Ta Tung, not a 
treaty port, a hundred miles above Wuhu. 
Wuhu and the whole country leading to 
Taiping, including the district itself, was under 
the jurisdiction of the rebels, whereas Ta Tung 
was still in possession of the imperialists. From 
Wuhu to Taiping by river the distance was 
about two hundred and fifty miles, whereas, by 
way of Ta Tung, the way, though shorter, 
was mostly overland, which made transportation 
more difficult and expensive, besides having to 
pay the imperialists a heavy war-tax at Ta 
Tung, while duty and war-tax were entirely free 
at Wuhu. 

In this expedition of inspection, I chose Wuhu 
as the basis of my operation. I started with four 
Chinese tea-men, natives of Taiping who had 
fled to Shanghai as refugees when the whole 
district was changed into a theatre of bloody 
conflicts between the imperialist and rebel forces 
for two years. On the way up the Wuhu River, 
we passed three cities mostly deserted by their 
inhabitants, but occupied by rebels. Paddy 
fields on both sides of the river were mostly left 
uncultivated and deserted, overrun with rank 
weeds and tall grass. As we ascended towards 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPIXG DISTRICT 127 

Taiping, the whole region presented a heart- 
rending and depressing scene of wild waste and 
devastation. Whole villages were depopulated 
and left in a dilapidated condition. Out of a 
population of 500,000 only a few dozen people 
were seen wandering about in a listless, hopeless 
condition very much emaciated and looking like 
walking skeletons. 

After a week's journey we reached the village 
of San Kow, where we were met and welcomed 
by three tea-men who had been in Shanghai 
about four years previous* It seemed that they 
had succeeded in weathering the storm which had 
swept away the bulk of the population and left 
them among the surviving few. They were 
mighty glad to see us, and our appearance in the 
village seemed to be a God-send. Among the 
houses that were left intact, I selected the best 
of them to be my headquarters for the transaction 
of the tea business. The old tea-men were 
brought in to co-operate in the business and they 
showed us where the tea was stored. I was told 
that in San Kow there were at least five hundred 
thousand boxes, but in the whole district of 
Taiping there were at least a million and a half 
boxes, about sixty pounds of tea to a box. 

At the end of another week, I returned to 



128 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Wuhu and reported all particulars. I had found 
that the way up from Wuhu by river to Taiping 
was perfectly safe and I did not anticipate any 
danger to life or treasure. I had seen a large 
quantity of the green tea myself and found out 
that all that was needed was to ship as much 
treasure as it was safe to have housed in Wuhu, 
and from there to have it transferred in country 
tea-boats, well escorted by men in case of any 
emergency. I also sent samples of the different 
kinds of green tea to Shanghai to be inspected 
and listed. These proved to be satisfactory, and 
the order came back to buy as much of the stock 
as could be bought. 

I was appointed the head of all succeeding ex- 
peditions to escort treasure up the river to San 
Kow and cargoes of tea from there to Wuhu. 
In one of these expeditions, I had a staff of six 
Europeans and an equal number of Chinese 
tea-men. We had eight boxes of treasure con- 
taining altogether Tls. 40,000. A tael, in the 
sixties, according to the exchange of that period, 
was equal to $1.33, making the total amount in 
Mexican dollars to be a little over $53,000. We 
had a fleet of eight tea-boats, four large ones and 
four smaller ones. The treasure was divided 
into two equal parts and was placed in the two 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 129 

largest and staunchest boats. The men were 
also divided into two squads, three Europeans 
and three Chinese in one large boat and an equal 
number in the other. We were well provided 
with firearms, revolvers and cutlasses. Besides 
the six Europeans, we had about forty men 
including the boatmen, but neither the six tea- 
men nor the boatmen could be relied upon to 
show fight in case of emergency. The only 
reliable men I had to fall back upon, in case of 
emergency, were the Europeans; even in these 
I was not sure I could place implicit confidence, 
for they were principally runaway sailors of an 
adventurous character picked up in Shanghai 
by the company and sent up to Wuhu to escort 
the treasure up to the interior. Among them 
was an Englishman who professed to be a vet- 
erinary doctor. He was over six feet tall in his 
stocking feet, a man of fine personal appearance, 
but he did not prove himself to be of very stout 
heart, as may be seen presently. Thus prepared 
and equipped, we left Wuhu in fine spirits. We 
proceeded on our journey a little beyond the city 
of King Yuen, which is about half the way to 
San Kow. We could have gone a little beyond 
King Yuen, but thinking it might be safer to be 
near the city, where the rebel chief had seen my 



130 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

passport, obtained in Nanking, and knew that 
I had influential people in Nanking, we con- 
cluded to pass the night in a safe secluded 
little cove in the hend of the river just large 
enough for our little boats to moor close to each 
other, taking due precaution to place the two 
largest ones in the center, flanked by the other 
boats on the right and left of them; the smal- 
ler boats occupied the extreme ends of the 
line. 

Before retiring, I had ordered all our firearms 
to be examined and loaded and properly dis- 
tributed. Watchmen were stationed in each 
boat to keep watch all night, for which they were 
to be paid extra. The precautionary steps hav- 
ing thus been taken, we all retired for the night. 
An old tea-man and myself were the only ones 
who lay wide awake while the rest gave unmis- 
takable signs of deep sleep. I felt somewhat 
nervous and could not sleep. The new moon had 
peeked in upon us occasionally with her cold 
smile, as heavy and dark clouds were scudding 
across her path. Soon she was shut in and 
disappeared, and all was shrouded in pitch dark- 
ness. The night was nearly half spent, when my 
ears caught the distant sound of whooping and 
yelling which seemed to increase in volume. I 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 131 

immediately started up to dress myself and 
quietly woke up the Europeans and Chinese in 
both boats. As the yelling and whooping drew 
nearer and nearer it seemed to come from a 
thousand throats, filling the midnight air with 
unearthly sounds. In another instant countless 
torch lights were seen dancing and whirling in 
the dismal darkness right on the opposite bank. 
Fortunately the river was between this maraud- 
ing band and us, while pitch darkness concealed 
our boats from their sight. In view of such 
impending danger, we held a council of war. 
None of us were disposed to fight and endanger 
our lives in a conflict in which the odds were 
fearfully against us, there being about a 
thousand to one. But the English veterinary 
doctor was the foremost and most strenuous of 
the Europeans to advocate passive surrender. 
His countenance actually turned pale and he 
trembled all over, whether from fear or the chilly 
atmosphere of the night I could not tell. Hav- 
ing heard from each one what he had to say, 
I could do nothing but step forward and speak 
to them, which I did in this wise: "Well, boys, 
you have all decided not to fight in case we are 
attacked, but to surrender our treasure. The 
ground for taking such a step is that we are sure 



132 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

to be outnumbered by a rebel host* So that in 
such a dilemma discretion is the better part of 
valor, and Tls. 40,000 are not worth sacrificing 
our lives for. But by surrendering our trust 
without making an eif ort of some kind to save 
it, we would be branded as unmitigated cowards, 
and we could never expect to be trusted with 
any responsible commission again* Now, I will 
tell you what I propose to do* If the rebel horde 
should come over and attempt to seize our 
treasure, I will spring forward with my yellow^ 
silk passport, and demand to see their chief, 
while you fellows with your guns and arms must 
stand by the treasure. Do not fire and start the 
fight. By parleying with them, it will for the 
moment check their determination to plunder, 
and they will have a chance to find out who we 
are, and where I obtained the passport; and, 
even if they should carry off the treasure, I shall 
tell their chief that I will surely report the whole 
proceeding in Nanking and recover every cent 
of our loss." 

These remarks seemed to revive the spirit and 
courage of the men, after which we all sat on the 
forward decks of our boats anxiously waiting for 
what the next moment would bring forth. 
While in this state of expectancy, our hearts 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 133 

palpitating in an audible fashion, our eyes were 
watching intently the opposite shore. All the 
shouting and yelling seemed to have died away, 
and nothing could be seen but torches moving 
about slowly and leisurely in regular detach- 
ments, each detachment stopping occasionally 
and then moving on again. This was kept up 
for over two hours, while they constantly 
receded from us. I asked an old boatman the 
meaning of such movements and was told that 
the marauding horde was embarking in boats 
along the whole line of the opposite shore and 
was moving down stream. It was three o'clock 
in the morning, and it began to rain. A few of 
the advance boats had passed us without dis- 
covering where we were. They were loaded with 
men and floated by us in silence. By four 
o'clock the last boats followed the rest and soon 
disappeared from sight. Evidently, from the 
stillness that characterized the long line of boats 
as they floated down stream, the buccaneering 
horde was completely used up by their looting 
expedition, and at once abandoned themselves 
to sound sleep when they got on board the boats. 
We thanked our stars for such a narrow escape 
from such an unlooked-for danger. We owed our 
safety to the darkness of the night, the rain and 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

to the fact that we were on the opposite shore in 
a retired cove. By five o'clock all our anxieties 
and fears were laid aside and turned into joy 
and thankfulness. We resumed our journey 
with light hearts and reached San Kow two days 
later in peace and safety. In less than two 
weeks we sent down to Wuhu, escorted by 
Europeans and tea-men, the first installment, 
consisting of fifteen boatloads of tea to be 
transhipped by steamer to Shanghai. The next 
installment consisted of twelve boatloads. I 
escorted that down the river in person. The 
river, in some places, especially in the summer, 
was quite shallow and a way had to be dug to 
float the boats down. In one or two instances 
the boatmen were very reluctant to jump into 
the water to do the work of deepening the river, 
and on one occasion I had to jump in, with the 
water up to my waist, in order to set them an 
example. When they caught the idea and saw 
me in the water, every man followed my example 
and vied with each other in clearing a way for 
the boats, for they saw I meant business and 
there was no fooling about it either. 

I was engaged in this Taiping tea business for 
about six months, and took away about sixty-five 
thousand boxes of tea, which was hardly a tenth 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 135 

part of the entire stock found in the district. 
Then I was taken down with the fever and ague 
of the worst type. As I could get no medical 
relief at Wuhu, I was obliged to return to 
Shanghai, where I was laid up sick for nearly 
two months. Those two months of sickness had 
knocked all ideas of making a big fortune out of 
my head. I gave up the Taiping tea enterprise, 
because it called for a greater sacrifice of health 
and wear upon my nervous system than I was 
able to stand. The King Yuen midnight inci- 
dent, which came near proving a disastrous one 
for me, with the marauding horde of unscrupu- 
lous cut-throats, had been quite a shock on my 
nervous system at the time and may have been 
the primal cause of my two months' sickness ; it 
served as a sufficient warning to me not to tax 
my nervous system by further encounters and 
disputes with the rebel chiefs, whose price on the 
tea we bought of them was being increased every 
day. A dispassionate and calm view of the enter- 
prise convinced me that I would have to preserve 
my life, strength and energy for a higher and 
worthier object than any fortune I might make 
out of this Taiping tea, which, after all, was 
plundered property. I am sure that no fortune 
In the world could be brought in the balance to 



136 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

weigh against my life, which is of inestimable 
value to me. 

Although I had made nothing out of the 
Taiping teas, yet the fearless spirit, the deter- 
mination to succeed, and the pluck to be able to 
do what few would undertake in face of excep- 
tional difficulties and hazards, that I had 
exhibited in the enterprise, were in themselves 
assets worth more to me than a fortune. I was 
well-known, both among foreign merchants and 
native business men, so that as soon as it was 
known that I had given up the Taiping tea 
enterprise on account of health, I was offered a 
tea agency in the port of Kew Keang for pack- 
ing teas for another foreign firm. I accepted it 
as a temporary shift, but gave it up in less than 
six months and started a commission business on 
my own account. I continued this business for 
nearly three years and was doing as well as I 
had expected to do. It was at this time while in 
Kew Keang that I caught the first ray of hope 
of materializing the educational scheme I had 
been weaving during the last year of my college 
life. 



CHAPTER XIII 

MY INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG 
KWOH FAN 

In 1863, I was apparently prospering in my 
business, when, to my great surprise, an unex- 
pected letter from the city of Ngan Khing, capi- 
tal of An Whui province, was received. The 
writer was an old friend whose acquaintance I 
had made in Shanghai in 1857. He was a native 
of Ningpo, and was in charge of the first Chinese 
gunboat owned by the local Shanghai guild. He 
had apparently risen in official rank and had 
become one of Tsang Kwoh Fan's secretaries. 
His name was Chang Shi Kwei. In this 
letter, Chang said he was authorized by Viceroy 
Tsang Kwoh Fan to invite me to come down to 
Ngan Khing to call, as he (the Viceroy) had 
heard of me and wished very much to see me. 
On the receipt of the letter I was in a quandary 
and asked myself many questions: What could 
such a distinguished man want of me? Had he 
got wind of my late visit to Nanking and of my 
late enterprise to the district of Taiping for the 

green tea that was held there by the rebels? 

137 



138 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Tsang Kwoh Fan himself had been in the depart- 
ment of Hwui Chow fighting the rebels a year 
before and had been defeated, and he was 
reported to have been killed in battle. Could he 
have been told that I had been near the scene 
of his battle and had been in communication with 
the rebels, and did he want, under a polite invi- 
tation, to trap me and have my head off? But 
Chang, his secretary, was an old friend of many 
years' standing. I knew his character well; he 
wouldn't be likely to play the cat's paw to have 
me captured. Thus deliberating from one sur- 
mise to another, I concluded not to accept the 
invitation until I had learned more of the great 
man's purpose in sending for me. 

In reply to the letter, I wrote and said I 
thanked His Excellency for his great condescen- 
sion and considered it a great privilege and honor 
to be thus invited, but on account of the tea 
season having set in (which was in February) , 
I was obliged to attend to the orders for packing 
tea that were fast coming in; but that as soon as 
they were off my hands, I would manage to go 
and pay my respects to His Excellency. 

Two months after receiving the first letter, a 
second one came urging me to come to Ngan 
Khing as early as possible. This second letter 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 139 

enclosed a letter written by Li Sien Lan, the 
distinguished Chinese mathematician, whose 
acquaintance I had also made while in Shang- 
hai. He was the man who assisted a Mr. 
Wiley, a missionary of the London Board of 
Missions, in the translation of several mathemati- 
cal works into Chinese, among which was the 
Integral and Differential Calculus over which 
I well remember to have "flunked and fizzled' 9 
in my sophomore year in college; and, in this 
connection, I might as well frankly own that in 
my make-up mathematics was left out. Mr. Li 
Sien Lan was also an astronomer. In his letter, 
he said he had told Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan 
who I was and that I had had a foreign educa- 
tion; how I had raised a handsome subscription 
to help the famine refugees in 1857; that I had 
a strong desire to help China to become prosper- 
ous, powerful and strong. He said the viceroy 
had some important business for me to do, and 
that Chu and Wa, who were interested in 
machinery of all kinds, were also in Ngan Khing, 
having been invited there by the Viceroy. Mr- 
Li's letter completely dispelled all doubts and 
misgivings on my part as to the viceroy's design 
in wishing to see me, and gave me an insight as 
to his purpose for sending for me. 



140 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

As an answer to these letters, I wrote saying 
that in a couple of months I should be more at 
liberty to take the journey. But my second 
reply did not seem to satisfy the strong desire 
on the part of Tsang Kwoh Fan to see me. So 
in July, 1868, I received a third letter from 
Chang and a second one from Li. In these 
letters the object of the viceroy was clearly and 
frankly stated. He wanted me to give up my 
mercantile business altogether and identify my- 
self under him in the service of the state govern- 
ment, and asked whether or not I could come 
down to Ngan Khing at once. In view of this 
unexpected offer, which demanded prompt and 
explicit decision, I was not slow to see what pos- 
sibility there was of carrying out my educational 
scheme, having such a powerful man as Tsang 
Kwoh Fan to back it. I immediately replied 
that upon learning the wishes of His Excellency, 
I had taken the whole situation into considera- 
tion, and had concluded to go to his headquarters 
at Ngan Khing, just as soon as I had wound up 
my business, which would take me a complete 
month, and that I would start by August at the 
latest. Thus ended the correspondence which was 
really the initiatory step of my official career. 

Tsang Kwoh Fan was a most remarkable 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 141 

character in Chinese history. He was regarded 
by his contemporaries as a great scholar and a 
learned man. Soon after the Taiping Rebellion 
broke out and began to assume vast proportions, 
carrying before it province after province, 
Tsang began to drill an army of his own com- 
patriots of 'Hunan who had always had the repu- 
tation of being brave and hardy fighters. In his 
work of raising a disciplined army, he secured 
the co-operation of other Hunan men, who after- 
wards took a prominent part in building up a 
flotilla of river gunboats. This played a great 
and efficient part as an auxiliary force on the 
Yangtze River, and contributed in no small 
measure to check the rapid and ready concen- 
tration of the rebel forces, which had spread 
over a vast area on both banks of the great 
Yangtze River. In the space of a few years 
the lost provinces were gradually recovered, till 
the rebellion was narrowed down within the 
single province of Kiang Su, of which Nanking, 
the capital of the rebellion, was the only strong- 
hold left. This finally succumbed to the forces of 
Tsang Kwoh Fan in 1864. 

To crush and end a rebellion of such dimen- 
sions as that of the Taipings was no small task. 
Tsang Kwoh Fan was made the generalissimo 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

of the imperialists. To enable him to cope suc- 
cessfully with the Taipings, Tsang was invested 
with almost regal power. The revenue of seven 
or eight provinces was laid at his feet for 
disposal, also official ranks and territorial 
appointments were at his command. So Tsang 
Kwoh Fan was literally and practically the 
supreme power of China at the time. But true 
to his innate greatness, he was never known to 
abuse the almost unlimited power that was 
placed in his hands, nor did he take advantage of 
the vast resources that were at his disposal to 
enrich himself or his family, relatives or friends. 
Unlike Li Hung Chang, his protege and suc- 
cessor, who bequeathed Tls. 40,000,000 to his 
descendants after his death, Tsang died compar- 
atively poor, and kept the escutcheon of his 
official career untarnished and left a name and 
character honored and revered for probity, pa- 
triotism and purity. He had great talents, but 
he was modest. He had a liberal mind, but he 
was conservative. He was a perfect gentleman 
and a nobleman of the highest type. It was such 
a man that I had the great fortune to come in 
contact with in the fall of 1863. 

After winding up my business in New Keang, 
I took passage in a native boat and landed at 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 143 

Ngan Khing in September. There, in the mili- 
tary headquarters of Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
I was met by my friends, Chang Si Kwei, Li 
Sien Lan, Wha Yuh Ting and Chu Siuh Chune, 
all old friends from Shanghai. They were glad 
to see me, and told me that the viceroy for the 
past six months, after hearing them tell that as 
a boy I had gone to America to get a Western 
education, had manifested the utmost curiosity 
and interest to see me, which accounted for the 
three letters which Chang and Li had written 
urging me to come. Now, since I had arrived, 
their efforts to get me there had not been fruitless, 
and they certainly claimed some credit for prais- 
ing me up to the viceroy. I asked them if they 
knew what His Excellency wanted me for, 
aside from the curiosity of seeing a native of 
China made into a veritable Occidental. They 
all smiled significantly and told me that I would 
find out after one or two interviews. From this, 
I judged that they knew the object for which 
I was wanted by the Viceroy, and perhaps, 
they were at the bottom of the whole 
secret. 

The next day I was to make my debut, and 
called. My card was sent in, and without a 
moment's delay or waiting in the ante-room, 



144 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

I was ushered into the presence of the great 
man of China. After the usual ceremonies 
of greeting, I was pointed to a seat right in front 
of him. For a few minutes he sat in silence, 
smiling all the while as though he were much 
pleased to see me, but at the same time his keen 
eyes scanned me over from head to foot to see if 
he could discover anything strange in my out- 
ward appearance. Finally, he took a steady look 
into my eyes which seemed to attract his special 
attention. I must confess I felt quite uneasy 
all the while, though I was not abashed. Then 
came his first question. 

"How long were you abroad ?" 

"I was absent from China eight years in pur- 
suit of a Western education." 

"Would you like to be a soldier in charge of a 
company?" 

"I should be pleased to head one if I had been 
fitted for it. I have never studied military 



science." 



"I should judge from your looks, you would 
make a fine soldier, for I can see from your eyes 
that you are brave and can command." 

"I thank Your Excellency for the compliment. 
I may have the courage of a soldier, but I cer- 
tainly lack military training and experience, and 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 145 

on that account I may not be able to meet Your 
Excellency's expectations/* 

When the question of being a soldier was sug- 
gested, I thought he really meant to have me 
enrolled as an officer in his army against the 
rebels ; but in this I was mistaken, as my Shang- 
hai friends told me afterwards. He simply put 
it forward to find out whether my mind was at 
all martially inclined. But when he found by my 
response that the bent of my thought was some- 
thing else, he dropped the military subject and 
asked me my age and whether or not I was mar- 
ried. The last question closed my first intro- 
ductory interview, which had lasted only about 
half an hour. He began to sip his tea and I did 
likewise, which according to Chinese official eti- 
quette means that the interview is ended and the 
guest is at liberty to take his departure., 

I returned to my room, and my Shanghai 
friends soon flocked around me to know what 
had passed between the viceroy and myself. I 
told them everything, and they were highly de- 
lighted. 

Tsang Kwoh Fan, as he appeared in 1863, 
was over sixty years of age, in the very prime of 
life. He was five feet, eight or nine inches tall, 
strongly built and well-knitted together and in 



146 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

fine proportion. He had a broad chest and 
square shoulders surmounted by a large sym- 
metrical head. He had a broad and high fore- 
head; his eyes were set on a straight line under 
triangular-shaped eyelids, free from that obliq- 
uity so characteristic of the Mongolian type of 
countenance usually accompanied by high cheek 
bones, which is another feature peculiar to the 
Chinese physiognomy. His face was straight 
and somewhat hairy. He allowed his side whisk- 
ers their full growth; they hung down with his 
full beard which swept across a broad chest and 
added dignity to a commanding appearance. 
His eyes though not large were keen and pene- 
trating. They were of a clear hazel color. His 
mouth was large but well compressed with thin 
lips which showed a strong will and a high pur- 
pose. Such was Tsang Kwoh Fan's external 
appearance, when I first met him at Ngan 
Khing. 

Regarding his character, he was undoubted- 
ly one of the most remarkable men of his age and 
time. As a military general, he might be called 
a self-made man; by dint of his indomitable per- 
sistence and perseverance, he rose from his high 
scholarship as a Hanlin (Chinese LL.D.) to be 
a generalissimo of all the imperial forces that 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 147 

were levied against the Taiping rebels, and in less 
than a decade after he headed his Hunan raw 
recruits, he succeeded in reducing the wide dev- 
astations of the rebellion that covered a terri- 
torial area of three of the richest provinces of 
China to the single one of Kiang Nan, till finally, 
by the constriction of his forces, he succeeded in 
crushing the life out of the rebellion by the fall 
and capture of Nanking, The Taiping Rebel- 
lion was of fifteen years' duration, from 1850 to 
1865. It was no small task to bring it to its ex- 
tinction. Its rise and progress had cost the Em- 
pire untold treasures, while 25,000,000 human 
lives were immolated in that political hecatomb. 
The close of the great rebellion gave the people 
a breathing respite. The Dowager Empress had 
special reasons to be grateful to the genius of 
Tsang Kwoh Fan, who was instrumental in re- 
storing peace and order to the Manchu Dynasty. 
She was not slow, however, to recognize Tsang 
Kwoh Fan's merits and moral worth and created 
him a duke. But Tsang' s greatness was not to be 
measured by any degree of conventional nobility; 
it did not consist in his victories over the rebels, 
much less in his re-capture of Nanking* It rose 
from his great virtues: his pure, unselfish patriot- 
ism, his deep and far-sighted statesmanship, and 



148 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the purity of his official career. He is known in 
history as "the man of rectitude." This was his 
posthumous title conferred on him by imperial 
decree- 
To resume the thread of my story, I was near- 
ly two weeks in the viceroy's headquarters, oc- 
cupying a suite of rooms in the same building 
assigned to my Shanghai friends Li, Chang, 
Wha and Chu. There were living in his military 
headquarters at least two hundred officials, gath- 
ered there from all parts of the Empire, for va- 
rious objects and purposes. Besides his secre- 
taries, who numbered no less than a hundred, 
there were expectant officials, learned scholars, 
lawyers, mathematicians, astronomers and ma- 
chinists; in short, the picked and noted men of 
China were all drawn there by the magnetic 
force of his character and great name. He al- 
ways had a great admiration for men of distin- 
guished learning and talents, and loved to asso- 
ciate and mingle with them. During the two 
weeks of my sojourn there, I had ample oppor- 
tunity to call upon my Shanghai friends, and in 
that way incidentally found out what the object 
of the Viceroy was in urging me to be enrolled 
in the government service. It seemed that my 
friends had had frequent interviews with the 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 149 

Viceroy in regard to having a foreign machine 
shop established in China, but it had not been de- 
termined what kind of a machine shop should be 
established* One evening they gave me a dinner, 
at which time the subject of the machine shop 
was brought up and it became the chief topic. 
After each man had expressed his views on the 
subject excepting myself, they wanted to know 
what my views were, intimating that in all like- 
lihood in my next interview with the Viceroy he 
would bring up the subject. I said that as I was 
not an expert in the matter, my opinions or sug- 
gestions might not be worth much, but neverthe- 
less from my personal observation in the United 
States and from a common-sense point of view, 
I would say that a machine shop in the present 
state of China should be of a general and funda- 
mental character and not one for specific pur- 
poses. In other words, I told them they ought 
to have a machine shop that would be able to 
create or reproduce other machine shops of the 
same character as itself; each and all of these 
should be able to turn out specific machinery 
for the manufacture of specific things. In plain 
words, they would have to have general and 
fundamental machinery in order to turn out 
specific machinery. A machine shop consisting 



150 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

of lathes of different kinds and sizes, planers and 
drills would be able to turn out machinery for 
making guns, engines, agricultural implements, 
clocks, etc. In a large country like China, I told 
them, they would need many primary or funda- 
mental machine shops, but that after they had 
one (and a first-class one at that) they could 
make it the mother shop for reproducing others 
perhaps better and more improved. If they 
had a number of them, it would enable them to 
have the shops co-operate with each other in case 
of need. It would be cheaper to have them re- 
produced and multiplied in China, I said, where 
labor and material were cheaper, than in Europe 
and America. Such was my crude idea of the 
subject. After I had finished, they were appar- 
ently much pleased and interested, and expressed 
the hope that I would state the same views to the 
Viceroy if he should ask me about the subject. 
Several days after the dinner and conversation, 
the Viceroy did send for me. In this interview 
he asked me what in my opinion was the best 
thing to do for China at that time. The question 
came with such a force of meaning, that if I had 
not been f orwarned by my friends a few evenings 
before, or if their hearts had not been set on the 
introduction of a machine shop, and they had not 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 151 

practically won the Viceroy over to their pet 
scheme, I might have been strongly tempted to 
launch forth upon my educational scheme as a 
reply to the question as to what was the best thing 
to do for China. But in such an event, being a 
stranger to the Viceroy, having been brought to 
his notice simply through the influence of my 
friends, I would have run a greater risk of jeop- 
ardizing my pet scheme of education than if I 
were left to act independently. My obligations 
to them were great, and I therefore decided that 
my constancy and fidelity to their friendship 
should be correspondingly great. So, instead of 
finding myself embarrassed in answering such a 
large and important question, I had a precon- 
ceived answer to give, which seemed to dove-tail 
into his views already crystallized into definite 
form, and which was ready to be carried out at 
once. So my educational scheme was put in the 
background, and the machine shop was allowed 
to take precedence. I repeated in substance 
what I had said to my friends previously in re- 
gard to establishing a mother machine shop, capa- 
ble of reproducing other machine shops of like 
character, etc. I especially mentioned the manu- 
facture of rifles, which, I said, required for the 
manufacture of their component parts separate 



152 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

machinery, but that the machine shop I would 
recommend was not one adapted for making the 
rifles, but adapted to turn out specific machinery 
for the making of rifles, cannons, cartridges, or 
anything else. 

"Well," said he, "this is a subject quite beyond 
my knowledge. It would be well for you to dis- 
cuss the matter with Wha and Chu, who are 
more familiar with it than I am and we will 
then decide what is best to be done." 

This ended my interview with the Viceroy. 
After I left him, I met my friends, who were 
anxious to know the result of the interview. I 
told them of the outcome. They were highly 
elated over it. In our last conference it was 
decided that the matter of the character of the 
machine shop was to be left entirely to my dis- 
cretion and judgment, after consulting a profes- 
sional mechanical engineer. At the end of another 
two weeks, Wha was authorized to tell me that 
the Viceroy, after having seen all the four men, 
had decided to empower me to go abroad and 
make purchases of such machinery as in the opin- 
ion of a professional engineer would be the best 
and the right machinery for China to adopt. It 
was also left entirely to me to decide where the 
machinery should be purchased, either in Eng- 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 158 

land, France or the United States of America. 
The location of the machine shop was to be at 
a place called Kow Chang Meu, about four miles 
northwest of the city of Shanghai. The Kow 
Chang Meu machine shop was afterwards known 
as the Kiang Nan Arsenal, an establishment that 
covers several acres of ground and embraces 
under its roof all the leading branches of me- 
chanical work. Millions have been invested in it 
since I brought the first machinery from Fitch- 
burg, Mass., in order to make it one of the great- 
est arsenals east of the Cape of Good Hope. It 
may properly be regarded as a lasting monument 
to commemorate Tsang Kwoh Fan's broad- 
mindedness as well as far-sightedness in estab- 
lishing Western machinery in China. 



CHAPTER XIV 

MY MISSION TO AMERICA TO BUY 
MACHINERY 

A week after my last interview with the Vice- 
roy and after I had been told that I was to be 
entrusted with the execution of the order, my 
commission was made out and issued to me. In 
addition to the commission, the fifth official rank 
was conferred on me. It was a nominal civil 
rank, with the privilege of wearing the blue 
feather, as was customary only in war time and 
limited to those connected with the military ser- 
vice, but discarded in the civil service, where the 
peacock's feather is conferred only by imperial 
sanction. Two official despatches were also made 
out, directing me where to receive the Tls. 
68,000, the entire amount for the purchase of 
the machinery* One-half of the amount was to 
be paid by the Taotai of Shanghai, and the other 
half by the Treasurer of Canton. After all the 
preliminary preparations had been completed, I 
bade farewell to the Viceroy and my Shanghai 

friends and started on my journey. 

154 



MY MISSION TO BUY MACHINERY 155 

On my arrival in Shanghai in October, 1863, 
I had the good fortune to meet Mr. John 
Haskins, an American mechanical engineer, who 
came out to China with machinery for Messrs. 
Russell & Co. He had finished his business with 
that firm and was expecting soon to return to the 
States with his family a wife and a little 
daughter. He was just the man I wanted. It 
did not take us long to get acquainted and as the 
time was short, we soon came to an understand- 
ing. We took the overland route from Hong 
Kong to London, via the Isthmus of Suez. 
Haskins and his family took passage on the 
French Messagerie Imperial line, while I 
engaged mine on board of one of the Peninsular 
& Oriental steamers. In my route to London, I 
touched at Singapore, crossed the Indian 
Ocean, and landed at Ceylon, where I changed 
steamers for Bengal up the Red Sea and landed 
at Cairo, where I had to cross the Isthmus by 
rail. The Suez Canal was not finished; the work 
of excavating was still going on. Arriving at 
Alexandria, I took passage from there to Mar- 
seilles, the southern port of France, while Has- 
kins and his family took a steamer direct for 
Southampton. From Marseilles I went to Paris 
by rail. I was there about ten days, long enough 



156 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

to give me a general idea of the city, its public 
buildings, churches, gardens, and of Parisian 
gaiety. I crossed the English channel from 
Calais to Dover and went thence by rail to 
London the first time in my life to touch Eng- 
lish soil, and my first visit to the famous metrop- 
olis. While in London, I visited Whitworth's 
machine shop, and had the pleasure of renewing 
my acquaintance with Thomas Christy, whom I 
knew in China in the *50's* I was about a month 
in England, and then crossed the Atlantic in one 
of the Cunard steamers and landed in New York 
in the early spring of 1864, just ten years after 
my graduation from Yale and in ample time to 
be present at the decennial meeting of my 
class in July. Haskins and his family had pre- 
ceded me in another steamer for New York, in 
order that he might get to work on the drawings 
and specifications of the shop and machinery and 
get them completed as soon as possble. In 1864, 
the last year of the great Civil War, nearly all 
the machine shops in the country, especially in 
New England, were preoccupied and busy in 
executing government orders, and it was very 
difficult to have my machinery taken up. Finally 
Haskins succeeded in getting the Putnam 
Machine Co., Fitchburg, Mass., to fill the order. 



MY MISSION TO BUY MACHINERY 157 

While Haskins was given sole charge of 
superintending the execution of the order, which 
required at least six months before the machinery 
could be completed for shipment to China, I took 
advantage of the interim to run down to New 
Haven and attend the decennial meeting of 
my class. It was to me a joyous event and I con- 
gratulated myself that I had the good luck to 
be present at our first re-union. Of course, the 
event that brought me back to the country was 
altogether unpretentious and had attracted little 
or no public attention at the time, because the 
whole country was completely engrossed in the 
last year of the great Civil War, yet I personally 
regarded my commission as an inevitable and 
preliminary step that would ultimately lead to 
the realization of my educational scheme, which 
had never for a moment escaped my mind. But 
at the meeting of my class, this subject of my 
life plan was not brought up. We had a 
most enjoyable time and parted with nearly the 
same fraternal feeling that characterized our 
parting at graduation. After the decennial 
meeting, I returned to Fitchburg and told Has- 
kins that I was going down to Washington to 
offer my services to the government as a volun- 
teer for the short period of six months, and that 



158 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

in case anything happened to me during the six 
months so that I could not come back to attend 
to the shipping of the machinery to Shanghai, 
he should attend to it. I left him all the 
papers the cost and description of the machin- 
ery, the bills of lading, insurance, and freight, 
and directed him to send everything to the 
Viceroy's agent in Shanghai. This precautionary 
step having been taken, I slipped down to Wash- 
ington. 

Brigadier-General Barnes of Springfield, 
Mass., happened to be the general in charge of 
the Volunteer Department. His headquarters 
were at Willard's Hotel. I called on him and 
made known to him my object, that I felt as a 
naturalized citizen of the United States, it was 
my bounden duty to offer my services as a 
volunteer courier to carry despatches between 
Washington and the nearest Federal camp for 
at least six months, simply to show my loyalty 
and patriotism to my adopted country, and that 
I would furnish my own equipments. He said 
that he remembered me well, having met me in 
the Yale Library in New Haven, in 1853, on a 
visit to his son, William Barnes, who was in the 
college at the time I was, and who afterwards 
became a prominent lawyer in San Francisco. 



MY MISSION TO BUY MACHINERY 159 

General Barnes asked what business I was en- 
gaged in. I told him that since my graduation 
in 1854 I had been in China and had recently 
returned with an order to purchase machinery 
for a machine shop ordered by Viceroy and 
Generalissimo Tsang Kwoh Fan. I told him 
the machinery was being made to order in Fitch- 
burg, Mass., under the supervision of an 
American mechanical engineer, and as it would 
take at least six months before the same could 
be completed, I was anxious to offer my services 
to the government in the meantime as an evidence 
of my loyalty and patriotism to my adopted 
country. He was quite interested and pleased 
with what I said. 

"Well, my young friend," said he, "I thank 
you very much for your offer, but since you are 
charged with a responsible trust to execute for 
the Chinese government, you had better return 
to Fitchburg to attend to it. We have plenty of 
men to serve, both as couriers and as fighting 
men to go to the front." Against this peremptory 
decision, I could urge nothing further, but I felt 
that I had at least fulfilled my duty to my 
adopted country. 



CHAPTER XV 
MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 

The machinery was not finished till the early 
spring of 1865. It was shipped direct from New 
York to Shanghai, China; while it was doubling 
the Cape of Good Hope on its way to the East, 
I took passage in another direction, hack to 
China. I wanted to encircle the globe once in my 
life, and this was my opportunity. I could say 
after that, that I had circumnavigated the globe. 
So I planned to go back by way of San Fran- 
cisco. In order to do that, I bad to take into 
consideration the fact that the Union Pacific 
from Chicago to San Francisco via Omaha was 
not completed, nor was any steamship line sub- 
sidized by the United States government to 
cross the Pacific from San Francisco to any sea- 
port, either in Japan or China at the time. On 
that account I was obliged to take a circuitous 
route, by taking a coast steamer from New York 
to Panama, cross the Isthmus, and from there 
take passage in another coast steamer up the 
Mexican coast to San Francisco, Cal. 

160 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 161 

At San Francisco, I was detained two weeks 
where I had to wait for a vessel to bridge me over 
the broad Pacific, either to Yokohama or Shang- 
hai. At that time, as there was no other vessel 
advertised to sail for the East, I was compelled 
to take passage on board the "Ida de Rogers," a 
Nantucket bark. There were six passengers, 
including myself. We had to pay $500 each for 
passage from San Francisco to Yokohama. 
The crew consisted of the captain, who had with 
him his wife, and a little boy six years old, a 
mate, three sailors and a cook, a Chinese boy. 
The "Ida de Rogers" was owned by Captain 
Norton who hailed from Nantucket. She was 
about one hundred and fifty feet long an old 
tub at that. Sh carried no cargo and little or no 
ballast, except bilge-water, which may have come 
from Nantucket, for aught I know. The skip- 
per, true to the point of the country where they 
produce crops of seamen of microscopic ideas, 
was found to be not at all deficient in his close 
calculations of how to shave closely in every bar- 
gain and, in fact, in everything in life. In this 
instance, we had ample opportunity to find out 
under whom we were sailing. Before we were 
fairly out of the "Golden Gate," we were treated 
every day with salted mackerel, which I took to 



162 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

be the daily and fashionable dish of Nantucket. 
The cook we had made matters worse, as he did 
not seem to know his business and was no doubt 
picked up in San Francisco just to fill the 
vacancy. The mackerel was cooked and brought 
on the table without being freshened, and the 
Indian meal cakes that were served with it, were 
but half baked, so that day after day we prac- 
tically all left the table disgusted and half 
starved. Not only was the food bad and un- 
healthy, but the skipper's family was of a very 
low type. The skipper himself was a most 
profane man, and although I never heard the 
wife swear, yet she seemed to enjoy her husband's 
oaths. Their little boy who was not more than 
six years old, seemed to have surpassed the father 
in profanity. It may be said that the young 
scamp had mastered his shorter and longer cate- 
chism of profanity completely, for he was not 
wanting in expressions of the most disgusting 
and repulsive kind, as taught him by his sire, yet 
his parents sat listening to him with evident satis- 
faction, glancing around at the passengers to 
catch their approval. One of the passengers, an 
Englishman, who stood near listening and smok- 
ing his pipe, only remarked ironically, "You 
have a smart boy there." At this the skipper 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 163 

nodded, while the mother seemed to gloat over 
her young hopeful. Such a scene was of daily 
occurrence, and one that we could not escape, 
since we were cooped up in such narrow quarters 
on account of the smaUness of the vessel. There 
was not even a five-foot deck where one could 
stretch his legs. We were most of the time shut 
up in the dining room, as it was the coolest spot 
we could find. Before our voyage was half over, 
we had occasion to land at one of the most north- 
erly islands of the Hawaiian group for fresh 
water and provisions. While the vessel was 
being victualed, all the passengers landed and 
went out to the country to take a stroll, which 
was a great relief. We were gone nearly all day. 
We all re-embarked early in the evening. It 
seemed that the captain had filled the forward 
hold with chickens and young turkeys. We con- 
gratulated ourselves that the skipper after all 
had swung round to show a generous streak, 
which had only needed an opportunity to show 
itself, and that for the rest of the voyage he was 
no doubt going to feed us on fresh chickens and 
turkeys to make up for the salted mackerel, 
which might have given us the scurvy had we 
continued on the same diet. For the first day or 
so, after we resumed our voyage, we had chicken 



164 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and fish for our breakfast and dinners, but that 
was the last we saw of the fresh provisions. We 
saw no turkey on the table. On making inquiry, 
the cook told us that both the chickens and the 
turkeys were bought, not for our table, but for 
speculation, to be sold on arrival in Yokohama. 
Unfortunately for the skipper, the chickens and 
turkeys for want of proper food and fresh air, 
had died a few days before our arrival at the port. 

Immediately upon reaching Yokohama, I 
took passage in a P. & O. steamer for Shanghai. 

On my arrival there, I found the machinery 
had all arrived a month before; it had all been 
delivered in good condition and perfect working 
order. I had been absent from China a little over 
a year. During that time Viceroy Tsang Kwoh 
Fan, with the co-operation of his brother, Tsang 
Kwoh Chuen, succeeded in the capture of Nan- 
king, which put an end to the great Taiping 
Rebellion of 1850. 

On my arrival in Shanghai, I found that the 
Viceroy had gone up to Chu Chow, the most 
northerly department of Kiangsu province, close 
to the border line of Shan Tung, and situated on 
the canal. He made that his headquarters in 
superintending the subjugation of the Nienfi or 
Anwhui rebels, against whom Li Hung Chang 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 165 

had been appointed as his lieutenant in the field. 
I was requested to go up to Chu Chow to make a 
report in person regarding the purchase of the 
machinery, 

On my journey to Chu Chow, I was accom- 
panied by my old friend Wha Yuh Ting part of 
the way. We went by the Grand Canal from 
Sinu-Mew at the Yangtze up as far as Yang 
Chow, the great entrepot for the Government 
Salt Monopoly. There we took mule carts over- 
land to Chu Chow. We were three days on our 
journey. Chu Chow is a departmental city and 
here, as stated before, Viceroy Tsang made his 
quarters. I was there three days. The Viceroy 
complimented me highly for what I had done. 
He made my late commission to the States to 
purchase machinery the subject of a special 
memorial to the government. Such a special 
memorial on any political event invariably gives 
it political prominence and weight, and in order 
to lift me at once from a position of no im- 
portance to a territorial civil appointment of the 
bona fide fifth rank, was a step seldom asked for 
or conceded. He made out my case to be an 
exceptional one, and the following is the lan- 
guage he used in his memorial: 

"Yung Wing is a foreign educated Chinese. 



166 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

He has mastered the English language. In his 
journey over thousands of miles of ocean to the 
extreme ends of the earth to fulfill the commission 
I entrusted to him, he was utterly oblivious to 
difficulties and dangers that lay in his way. In 
this respect even the missions of the Ancients 
present no parallel equal to his* Therefore, I 
would recommend that he he promoted to the 
expectancy of one of the Kiangsu suhprefects, 
and he is entitled to fill the first vacancy pre- 
senting itself, in recognition of his valuable 



services." 



His secretary, who drew up the memorial at 
his dictation, gave me a copy of the memorial 
before I left Chu Chow for Shanghai, and con- 
gratulated me on the great honor the Viceroy 
had conferred on me. I thanked the Viceroy 
before bidding him good-bye, and expressed the 
hope that my actions in the future would justify 
his high opinion of me. 

In less than two months after leaving him, an 
official document from the Viceroy reached me in 
Shanghai, and in October, 1865, I was a full- 
fledged mandarin of the fifth rank. While wait- 
ing as an expectant subprefect, I was retained 
by the provincial authorities as a government 
interpreter and translator. My salary was $250 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 167 

per month. No other expectant official of the 
province not even an expectant Taotai (an of- 
ficial of the fourth rank) could command such 
a salary. 

Ting Yih Chang was at the time Taotai of 
Shanghai. He and I became great friends. He 
rose rapidly in official rank and became succes- 
sively salt commissioner, provincial treasurer 
and Taotai or governor of Kiang Nan. Through 
him, I also rose in official rank and was decorated 
with the peacock's feather. While Ting Yih 
Chang was salt commissioner, I accompanied 
him to Yang Chow and was engaged in translat- 
ing Colton's geography into Chinese, for about 
six months. I then returned to Shanghai to re- 
sume my position as government interpreter and 
translator. I had plenty of time on my hands. I 
took to translating "Parsons on Contracts," 
which I thought might be useful to the Chinese. 
In this work I was fortunate in securing the ser- 
vices of a Chinese scholar to help me. I found 
him well versed in mathematics and in all Chinese 
official business, besides being a fine Chinese 
scholar and writer. He finally persuaded me not 
to continue the translation, as there was some 
doubt as to whether such a work, even when 
finished, would be in demand, because the 



168 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Chinese courts are seldom troubled with litiga- 
tions on contracts, and in all cases of violation of 
contracts, the Chinese code is used. 

In 1867, Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, with 
Li Hung Chang's co-operation, succeeded in 
ending the Nienfi rebellion, and came to Nan- 
king to fill his viceroyalty of the two 
Kiangs. 

Before taking up his position as viceroy of 
the Kiangs permanently, he took a tour of in- 
spection through his jurisdiction and one of the 
important places he visited was Shanghai and 
the Kiang Nan Arsenal an establishment of his 
own creation. He went through the arsenal with 
undisguised interest. I pointed out to him the 
machinery which I bought for him in America. 
He stood and watched its automatic movement 
with unabated delight, for this was the first time 
he had seen machinery, and how it worked. 
It was during this visit that I succeeded in per- 
suading him to have a mechanical school annexed 
to the arsenal, in which Chinese youths might be 
taught the theory as well as the practice of 
mechanical engineering, and thus enable China 
in time to dispense with the employment of 
foreign mechanical engineers and machinists, and 
to be perfectly independent. This at once ap- 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 169 

pealed to the practical turn of the Chinese mind, 
and the school was finally added to the arsenaL 
They are doubtless turning out at the present 
time both mechanical engineers and machinists of 
all descriptions. 



CHAPTER XVI 

PROPOSAL OF MY EDUCATIONAL 
SCHEME 

Having scored in a small way this educa- 
tional victory, by inducing the Viceroy to estab- 
lish a mechanical training school as a corollary 
to the arsenal, I felt quite worked up and encour- 
aged concerning my educational scheme which 
had been lying dormant in my mind for the past 
fifteen years, awaiting an opportunity to be 
brought forward. 

Besides Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, whom I 
counted upon to back me in furthering the 
scheme, Ting Yih Chang, an old friend of mine, 
had become an important factor to be reckoned 
with in Chinese politics. He was a man of pro- 
gressive tendencies and was alive to all practical 
measures of reform. He had been appointed 
governor of Kiangsu province, and after his 
accession to his new office, I had many inter- 
views with him regarding my educational scheme, 
in which he was intensely interested. He told 

me that he was in correspondence with Wen 

170 



MY EDUCATIONAL SCHEME 171 

Seang, the prime minister of China, who was a 
Manchu, and that if I were to put my scheme in 
writing, he would forward it to Peking, and ask 
Wen Seang to use his influence to memorialize 
the government for its adoption. Such an unex- 
pected piece of information came like a clap of 
thunder and fairly lifted me off my feet. I im- 
mediately left Suchau for Shanghai. With the 
help of my Nanking friend, who had helped me 
in the work of translating "Parsons on Con- 
tracts," I drew up four proposals to be present- 
ed to Governor Ting, to be forwarded by him to 
Minister Wen Seang, at Peking. They were as 
follows : 

FIRST PROPOSAL 

The first proposal contemplated the organiza- 
tion of a Steamship Company on a joint stock 
basis. No foreigner was to be allowed to be a 
stockholder in the company. It was to be a 
purely Chinese company, managed and worked 
by Chinese exclusively. 

To insure its stability and success, an annual 
government subsidy was to be made in the shape 
of a certain percentage of the tribute rice 
carried to Peking from Shanghai and Chinkiang, 



172 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and elsewhere, where tribute rice is paid over to 
the government in lieu of taxes in money. This 
tribute rice heretofore had been taken to Peking 
by flat-bottom boats, via the Grand Canal. 
Thousands of these boats were built expressly 
for this rice transportation, which supported a 
large population all along the whole route of the 
Grand Canal. 

On account of the great evils arising from this 
mode of transportation, such as the great length 
of time it took to take the rice to Peking, the 
great percentage of loss from theft, and from 
fermentation, which made the rice unfit for food, 
part of the tribute rice was carried by sea in 
Ningpo junks as far as Tiensin, and from thence 
transhipped again in flat-bottom boats to Peking. 
But even the Ningpo junk system was attended 
with great loss of time and much damage, almost 
as great as by flat-bottom scows* My proposi- 
tion was to use steam to do the work, supplanting 
both the flat-bottomed scows and the Ningpo 
junk system, so that the millions who were de- 
pendent on rice for subsistence might find it 
possible to get good and sound rice. This is 
one of the great benefits and blessings which the 
China Merchant Steamship Co. has conferred 
upon China. 



SECOND PROPOSAL 

The second proposition was for the govern- 
ment to send picked Chinese youths abroad to be 
thoroughly educated for the public service. The 
scheme contemplated the education of one hun- 
dred and twenty students as an experiment. 
These one hundred and twenty students were to 
be divided into four installments of thirty 
students each, one installment to be sent out 
each year. They were to have fifteen years 
to finish their education. Their average age was 
to be from twelve to fourteen years. If the 
first and second installments proved to be a suc- 
cess, the scheme was to be continued indefinitely. 
Chinese teachers were to be provided to keep up 
their knowledge of Chinese while in the United 
States. Over the whole enterprise two commis- 
sioners were to be appointed, and the govern- 
ment was to appropriate a certain percentage of 
the Shanghai customs to maintain the mission. 

THIRD PROPOSAL 

The third proposition was to induce the gov- 
ernment to open the mineral resources of the 
country and thus in an indirect way lead to the 



174 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

necessity of introducing railroads to transport 
the mineral products from the interior to the 
ports. 

I did not expect this proposition to be adopted 
and carried out, because China at that time had 
no mining engineers who could be depended 
upon to develop the mines, nor were the people 
free from the Fung Shui superstition.* I had no 
faith whatever in the success of this proposition, 
but simply put it in writing to show how ambi- 
tious I was to have the government wake up to 
the possibilities of the development of its vast 
resources. 

FOUETH PROPOSAL 

The encroachment of foreign powers upon the 
independent sovereignty of China has always 
been watched by me with the most intense inter- 
est. No one who is at all acquainted with Roman 
Catholicism can fail to be impressed with the 
unwarranted pretensions and assumptions of the 
Romish church in China. She claims civil juris- 

*The doctrine held by the Chinese in relation to the spirits or 
genii that rule over winds and waters, especially running streams 
and subterranean waters. This doctrine is universal and inveterate 
among the Chinese, and in a great measure prompts their hostility 
to railroads and telegraphs, since they believe that such structures 
anger the spirits of the air and waters and consequently cause 
floods and typhoons. Standard Dictionary. 



MY EDUCATIONAL SCHEME 175 

diction over her proselytes, and takes civil and 
criminal cases out of Chinese courts* In order to 
put a stop to such insidious and crafty workings 
to gain temporal power in China, I put forth 
this proposition: to prohibit missionaries of any 
religious sect or denomination from exercising 
any kind of jurisdiction over their converts, in 
either civil or criminal cases. These four propo- 
sitions were carefully drawn up, and were pre- 
sented to Governor Ting for transmission to 
Peking. 

Of the four proposals, the first, third and 
fourth were put in to chaperone the second, in 
which my whole heart was enlisted, and which 
above all others was the one I wanted to be taken 
up ; but not to give it too prominent a place, at the 
suggestion of my Chinese teacher, it was as- 
signed a second place in the order of the arrange- 
ment. Governor Ting recognized this, and ac- 
cordingly wrote to Prime Minister Wen Seang 
and forwarded the proposals to Peking. Two 
months later, a letter from Ting, at Suchau, his 
headquarters, gave me to understand that news 
from Peking had reached him that Wen Seang's 
mother had died, and he was obliged, according 
to Chinese laws and customs, to retire from office 



176 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and go into mourning for a period of twenty- 
seven months, equivalent to three years, and to 
abstain altogether from public affairs of all 
kinds. This news threw a cold blanket over my 
educational scheme for the time being. No sooner 
had one misfortune happened than another took 
its place, worst than the first Wen Seang him- 
self, three months afterwards, was overtaken by 
death during his retirement. This announce- 
ment appeared in the Peking "Gazette," which I 
saw, besides being officially informed of it by 
Governor Ting. No one who had a pet scheme 
to promote or a hobby to ride could feel more 
blue than I did, when the cup of joy held so near 
to his lips was dashed from him. I was not entire- 
ly disheartened by such circumstances, but had an 
abiding faith that my educational scheme would 
in the end come out all right. There was an 
interval of at least three years of suspense and 
waiting between 1868 and 1870. I kept pegging 
at Governor Ting, urging him to keep the sub- 
ject constantly before Viceroy Tsang's mind. 
But like the fate of all measures of reform, it had 
to abide its time and opportunity. 

The time and the opportunity for my educa- 
tional scheme to materialize finally came. Con- 
trary to all human expectations, the opportunity 



MY EDUCATIONAL SCHEME 177 

appeared in the guise of the Tientsin Massacre. 
No more did Samson, when he slew the Tim- 
nath lion, expect to extract honey from its 
carcass than did I expect to extract from the 
slaughter of the French nuns and Sisters of 
Charity the educational scheme that was destined 
to make a new China of the old, and to work out 
an Oriental civilization on an Occidental basis. 

The Tientsin Massacre took place early in 
1870. It arose from the gross ignorance and 
superstition of the Tientsin populace regarding 
the work of the nuns and Sisters of Charity, part 
of whose religious duty it was to rescue found- 
lings and castaway orphans, who were gathered 
into hospitals, cared for and educated for the 
services of the Roman Catholic church. This 
beneficent work was misunderstood and miscon- 
strued by the ignorant masses, who really be- 
lieved in the rumors and stories that the infants 
and children thus gathered in were taken into 
the hospitals and churches to have their eyes 
gouged out for medical and religious purposes. 
Such diabolical reports soon spread like wild-fire 
till popular excitement was worked up to its 
highest pitch of frenzy, and the infuriated mob, 
regardless of death and fearless of law, plunged 
headlong into the Tientsin Massacre. In that 



178 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

massacre a Protestant church was burned and 
destroyed, as was also a Roman Catholic church 
and hospital; several nuns or Sisters of Charity 
were killed. 

At the time of this occurrence, Chung Hou 
was viceroy of the Metropolitan province. He 
had been ambassador to Russia previously, but 
in this unfortunate affair, according to Chinese 
law, he was held responsible, was degraded from 
office and banished. The whole imbroglio was 
finally settled and patched up by the payment of 
an indemnity to the relatives and friends of the 
victims of the massacre and the rebuilding of 
the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, 
another Catholic hospital, besides a suitable 
official apology made by the government for the 
incident. Had the French government not been 
handicapped by the impending German War 
which threatened her at the time, France would 
certainly have made the Tientsin Massacre a 
casus belli, and another slice of the Chinese 
Empire would have been annexed to the French 
possessions in Asia. As it was, Tonquin, a trib- 
utary state of China, was afterwards unscrupu- 
lously wrenched from her. 

In the settlement of the massacre, the Imperial 
commissioners appointed were: Viceroy Tsang 



MY EDUCATIONAL SCHEME 179 

Kwoh Fan, Mow Chung Hsi, Liu * * * and 
Ting Yih Chang, Governor of Kiang Su. Li 
Hung Chang was still in the field finishing up 
the Nienfi rebellion, otherwise he, too, would have 
been appointed to take part in the proceedings 
of the settlement. I was telegraphed for by my 
friend, Ting Yih Chang, to be present to act as 
interpreter on the occasion, but the telegram did 
not reach me in time for me to accompany him to 
Tientsin; but I reached Tientsin in time to wit- 
ness the last proceedings* The High Commis- 
sioners, after the settlement with the French, for 
some reason or other, did not disband, but re- 
mained in Tientsin for several days. They evi- 
dently had other matters of State connected with 
Chung Hou's degradation and banishment to 
consider. 



CHAPTER XVII 

THE CHINESE EDUCATIONAL 
MISSION 

Taking advantage of their presence, I seized 
the opportunity to press my educational scheme 
upon the attention of Ting Yih Chang and 
urged him to present the subject to the Board of 
Commissioners of which Tsang Kwoh Fan was 
president. I knew Ting sympathized with me in 
the scheme, and I knew, too, that Tsang Kwoh 
Fan had been well informed of it three years 
before through Governor Ting. Governor Ting 
took up the matter in dead earnest and held 
many private interviews with Tsang Kwoh Fan 
as well as with the other members of the Com- 
mission. One evening, returning to his head- 
quarters very late, he came to my room and 
awakened me and told me that Viceroy Tsang 
and the other Commissioners had unanimously 
decided to sign their names conjointly in a 
memorial to the government to adopt my four 
propositions. This piece of news was too much 

to allow me to sleep any more that night; while 

180 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 181 

lying on my bed, as wakeful as an owl, I felt as 
though I were treading on clouds and walking 
in air. Two days after this stirring piece of 
news, the memorial was jointly signed with 
Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan's name heading the 
list, and was on its way to Peking by pony ex- 
press. Meanwhile, before the Board of Com- 
missioners disbanded and Viceroy Tsang took 
his departure for Nanking, it was decided that 
Chin Lan Pin, a member of the Hanlin College, 
who had served twenty years as a clerk in the 
Board of Punishment, should be recommended by 
Ting to co-operate with me in charge of the Chi- 
nese Educational Commission. The ground 
upon which Chin Lan Pin was recommended as 
a co-commissioner was that he was a Han Lin and 
a regularly educated Chinese, and the enterprise 
would not be so likely to meet with the opposi- 
tion it might have 'if I were to attempt to carry 
it out alone, because the scheme in principle and 
significance was against the Chinese theory of 
national education, and it would not have taken 
much to create a reaction to defeat the plan on 
account of the intense conservatism of the gov- 
ernment. The wisdom and the shrewd policy of 
such a move appealed to me at once, and I ac- 
cepted the suggestion with pleasure and alacrity. 



182 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

So Chin Lan Pin was written to and came to 
Tientsin. The next day, after a farewell dinner 
had been accorded to the Board of Commission- 
ers before it broke up, Governor Ting intro- 
duced me to Chin Lan Pin, whom I had never 
met before and who was to be my associate in 
the educational scheme. He evidently was 
pleased to quit Peking, where he had been 
cooped up in the Board of Punishment for 
twenty years as a clerk. He had never filled a 
government position in any other capacity in his 
life, nor did he show any practical experience in 
the world of business and hard facts* In his 
habits he was very retiring, but very scholarly. 
In disposition he was kindly and pleasant, but 
very timid and afraid of responsibilities of even a 
feather's weight. 

In the winter of 1870, Tsang Kwoh Fan, after 
having settled the Tientsin imbroglio, returned 
to Nanking, his headquarters as the viceroy of 
the two Kiangs. There he received the imperial 
rescript sanctioning his joint memorial on the 
four proposals submitted through Ting Yih 
Chang for adoption by the government. He 
notified me on the subject. It was a glorious 
piece of news, and the Chinese educational project 
thus became a veritable historical fact, marking 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 183 

a new era in the annals of China. Tsang invited 
me to repair to Nanking, and during that visit 
the most important points connected with the 
mission were settled, viz.: the establishment of 
a preparatory school; the number of students to 
be selected to be sent abroad; where the money 
was to come from to support the students while 
there; the number of years they were to be al- 
lowed to remain there for their education. 

The educational commission was to consist 
of two commissioners, Chin Lan Pin and myself. 
Chin Lan Pin's duty was to see that the students 
should keep up their knowledge of Chinese while 
in America; my duty was to look after their for- 
eign education and to find suitable homes for 
them. Chin Lan Pin and myself were to look 
after their expenses conjointly. Two Chinese 
teachers were provided to keep up their studies in 
Chinese, and an interpreter was provided for the 
Commission. Yeh Shu Tung and Yung Yune 
Foo were the Chinese teachers and Tsang Lai 
Sun was the interpreter. Such was the com- 
position of the Chinese Educational Commis- 
sion. 

As to the character and selection of the 
students: the whole number to be sent abroad 
for education was one hundred and twenty; they 



184 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

were to be divided into four installments of 
thirty members each, one installment to be sent 
each year for four successive years at about the 
same time. The candidates to be selected were not 
to be younger than twelve or older than fifteen 
years of age. They were to show respectable par- 
entage or responsible and respectable guardians. 
They were required to pass a medical examina- 
tion, and an examination in their Chinese studies 
according to regulation reading and writing in 
Chinese also to pass an English examination if 
a candidate had been in an English school. All 
successful candidates were required to repair 
every day to the preparatory school, where teach- 
ers were provided to continue with their Chinese 
studies, and to begin the study of English or to 
continue with their English studies, for at least 
one year before they were to embark for the 
United States. 

Parents and guardians were required to sign 
a paper which stated that without recourse, they 
were perfectly willing to let their sons or 
proteges go abroad to be educated for a period 
of fifteen years, from the time they began their 
studies in the United States until they had 
finished, and that during the fifteen years, the 
government was not to be responsible for death 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 185 

or for any accident that might happen to any 
student. 

The government guaranteed to pay all their 
expenses while they were heing educated. It 
was to provide every installment with a Chinese 
teacher to accompany it to the United States, 
and to give each installment of students a suit- 
able outfit. Such were the requirements and the 
organization of the student corps. 

Immediately upon my return to Shanghai 
from Nanking after my long interview with the 
Viceroy, my first step was to have a preparatory 
school established in Shanghai for the accommo- 
dation of at least thirty students, which was the 
full complement for the first installment. t Liu 
Kai Sing, who was with the Viceroy for a 
number of years as his first secretary in the 
Department on Memorials, was appointed 
superintendent of the preparatory school in 
Shanghai. In him, I found an able coadjutor 
as well as a staunch friend who took a deep 
interest in the educational scheme. He it was 
who prepared all the four installments of stu- 
dents to come to this country. 

Thus the China end of the scheme was set 
afloat in the summer of 1871. To make up the 
full complement of the first installment of 



186 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

students, I had to take a trip down to Hong 
Kong to visit the English government schools to 
select from them a few bright candidates who 
had had some instruction both in English and 
Chinese studies. As the people in the northern 
part of China did not know that such an educa- 
tional scheme had been projected by the govern- 
ment, there being no Chinese newspapers pub- 
lished at that time to spread the news among 
the people, we had, at first, few applications for 
entrance into the preparatory school. All the 
applications came from the Canton people, 
especially from the district of Heang Shan. 
This accounts for the fact that nine-tenths of the 
one hundred and twenty government students 
were from the south. 

In the winter of 1871, a few months after the 
preparatory school had begun operations, China 
suffered an irreparable loss by the death of Vice- 
roy Tsang Kwoh Fan, who died in Nanking at 
the ripe age of seventy-one years. Had his life 
been spared even a year longer, he would have 
seen the first installment of thirty students start- 
ed for the United States, the first fruit of his 
own planting. But founders of all great and 
good works are not permitted by the nature and 
order of things to live beyond their ordained Mm- 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 187 

itations to witness the successful developments 
of their own labor in this world; but the conse- 
quences of human action and human character, 
when once their die is cast, will reach to eternity. 
Sufficient for Tsang Kwoh Fan that he had 
completed his share in the educational line well. 
He did a great and glorious work for China and 
posterity, and those who were privileged to reap 
the benefit of his labor will find ample reason to 
bless him as China's great benefactor. Tsang, 
as a statesman, a patriot, and as a man, towered 
above his contemporaries even as Mount Everest 
rises above the surrounding heights of the Hima- 
laya range, forever resting in undisturbed calm- 
ness and crowned with the purity of everlasting 
snow. Before he breathed his last, I was told 
that it was his wish that his successor and pro- 
tege, Li Hung Chang, be requested to take up 
his mantle and carry on the work of the Chinese 
Educational Commission. 

Li Hung Chang was of an altogether different 
make-up from his distinguished predecessor and 
patron. He was of an excitable and nervous 
temperament, capricious and impulsive, suscep- 
tible to flattery and praise, or, as the Chinese 
laconically put it, he was fond of wearing tall 
hats. His outward manners were brusque, but 



188 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

he was inwardly kind-hearted. As a statesman 
he was far inferior to Tsang; as a patriot and 
politician, his character could not stand a mo- 
ment before the searchlight of cold and impartial 
history. It was under such a man that the 
Chinese Educational Commission was launched 
forth. 

In the latter part of the summer of 1872 the 
first installment of Chinese students, thirty in 
number, were ready to start on the passage 
across the Pacific to the United States. In order 
that they might have homes to go to on their 
arrival, it devolved upon me to precede them by 
one month, leaving Chin Lan Pin, the two 
Chinese teachers and their interpreter to come on 
a mail later. After reaching New York by the 
Baltimore and Ohio, via Washington, I went as 
far as New Haven on my way to Springfield, 
Mass., where I intended to meet the students and 
other members of the commission on their way 
to the East by the Boston and Albany Railroad. 
At New Haven, the first person I called upon to 
announce my mission was Prof. James Hadley. 
He was indeed glad to see me, and was delighted 
to know that I had come back with such a mission 
in my hands. After making my wants known 
to him, he immediately recommended me to call 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 189 

upon Mr. B. G. Northrop, which I did, Mr. 
Northrop was then Commissioner of Education 
for Connecticut. I told him my business and 
asked his advice. He strongly recommended me 
to distribute and locate the students in New 
England families, either by twos or fours to 
each family, where they could be cared for and at 
the same time instructed, till they were able to 
join classes in graded schools. This advice I 
followed at once. I went on to Springfield, 
Mass., which city I considered was the most 
central point from which to distribute the stu- 
dents in New England; for this reason I chose 
Springfield for my headquarters. This enabled 
me to be very near my friends, Dr. A. S. 
McClean and his worthy wife, both of whom had 
been my steadfast friends since 1854. 

But through the advice of Dr. B. G. Northrop 
and other friends, I made my permanent head- 
quarters in the city of Hartford, Conn. 5 and for 
nearly two years our headquarters were located 
on Sumner Street. I did not abandon Spring- 
field, but made it the center of distribution and 
location of the students as long as they continued 
to come over, which was for three successive years, 
ending in 1875. 

In 1874, Li Hung Chang, at the recommen- 



190 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

dation of the commission, authorized me to put 
up a handsome, substantial building on Collins 
Street as the permanent headquarters of the 
Chinese Educational Commission in the United 
States. In January, 1875, we moved into our 
new headquarters, which was a large, double 
three-story house spacious enough to accommo- 
date the Commissioners, teachers and seventy- 
five students at one time. It was provided with 
a school-room where Chinese was exclusively 
taught; a dining room, a double kitchen, dormi- 
tories and bath rooms. The motive which led 
me to build permanent headquarters of our own 
was to have the educational mission as deeply 
rooted in the United States as possible, so as not 
to give the Chinese government any chance of 
retrograding in this movement. Such was my 
proposal, but that was not God's disposal as sub- 
sequent events plainly proved. 



CHAPTER XVIII 

INVESTIGATION OF THE COOLIE 
TRAFFIC IN PERU 

In the spring of 1873, I returned to China on 
a flying visit for the sole purpose of introducing 
the Catling gun a comparatively new weapon 
of warfare of a most destructive character. I 
had some difficulty in persuading the Gatling 
Company to give me the sole agency of the gun 
in China, hecause they did not know who I was, 
and were unacquainted with my practical busi- 
ness experience. In fact, they did not know how 
successfully I had carried on the Taiping Green 
Tea Expedition in 1860-1, in the face of dangers 
and privations which few men dared to face. 
However, I prevailed on the president of the 
company, Dr. Gatling himself, the inventor of 
the gun, to entrust me with the agency. Exactly 
a month after my arrival in Tientsin, I cabled 
the company an order for a battery of fifty guns, 
which amounted altogether to something over 
$100,000, a pretty big order for a man who it 

was thought could not do anything. This order 

191 



192 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

was followed by subsequent orders. I was 
anxious that China should have the latest modern 
guns as well as the latest modern educated men. 
The Gatling Company was satisfied with my 
work and had a different opinion of me after- 
wards. 

While I was in Tientsin, attending to the gun 
business, the Viceroy told me that the Peruvian 
commissioner was there waiting to make a 
treaty with China regarding the further impor- 
tation of coolie labor into Peru. He wanted me 
to call on the commissioner and talk with him on 
the subject, which I did. In his conversation, 
he pictured to me in rosy colors how well the 
Chinese were treated in Peru; how they were 
prospering and doing well there, and said that the 
Chinese government ought to conclude a treaty 
with Peru to encourage the poorer class of 
Chinese to emigrate to that country, which 
offered a fine chance for them to better them- 
selves. I told him that I knew something about 
the coolie traffic as it was carried on in Macao; 
how the country people were inveigled and kid- 
napped, put into barracoons and kept there by 
force till they were shipped on board, where they 
were made to sign labor contracts either for 
Cuba or Peru. On landing at their destination. 



INVESTIGATION OF COOLIE TRAFFIC 193 

they were then sold to the highest bidder, and 
made to sign another contract with their new 
masters, who took special care to have the con- 
tract renewed at the end of every term, prac- 
tically making slaves of them for life. Then I 
told him something about the horrors of the 
middle passage between Macao and Cuba or 
Peru; how whole cargoes of them revolted in 
mid-ocean, and either committed wholesale sui- 
cide by jumping into the ocean, or else over- 
powered the captain and the crew, killed them 
and threw them overboard, and then took their 
chances in the drifting of the vessel. 

Such were some of the facts and horrors of 
the coolie traffic I pictured to the Peruvian Com- 
missioner. I told him plainly that he must not 
expect me to help him in this diabolical business. > 
On the contrary, I told him I would dissuade the 
Viceroy from entering into a treaty with Peru to 
carry on such inhuman traffic. How the Peru- 
vian's countenance changed when he heard me 
deliver my mind on the subject! Disappoint- 
ment, displeasure and anger were visible in his 
countenance. I bade him good morning, for I 
was myself somewhat excited as I narrated what 
I had seen in Macao and what I had read in the 
papers about the coolie traffic. Indeed, one of 



194 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the first scenes I had seen on my arrival in Macao 
in 1855 was a string of poor Chinese coolies tied 
to each other hy their cues and led into one of the 
barracoons like abject slaves. Once, while in 
Canton, I had succeeded in having two or three 
kidnappers arrested, and had them put into 
wooden collars weighing forty pounds, which the 
culprits had to carry night and day for a couple 
of months as a punishment for their kidnapping. 

Returning to the Viceroy, I told him I had 
made the call, and narrated my interview. The 
Viceroy, to make my visit short, then said, "You 
have come back just in time to save me from 
cabling you. I wish you to return to Hartford 
as quickly as possible and make preparations to 
proceed to Peru at once, to look into the condi- 
tion of the Chinese coolies there." 

On my return to Hartford, I found that Chin 
Lan Pin had also been instructed by the gov- 
ernment to look after the condition of the 
Chinese coolies in Cuba. These collateral or side 
missions were ordered at Li Hung Chang's sug- 
gestion. I started on my mission before Chin 
Lan Pin did. My friend, the Rev. J. H. 
Twichell, and Dr. E. W. Kellogg, who after- 
wards became my brother-in-law, accompanied 
me on my trip. I finished my work inside of 



INVESTIGATION OF COOLIE TRAFFIC 195 

three months, and had my report completed be- 
fore Chin started on his journey to Cuba. On 
his return, both of our reports were forwarded 
to Viceroy Li, who was in charge of all foreign 
diplomatic affairs. 

My report was accompanied with two dozen 
photographs of Chinese coolies, showing how 
their backs had been lacerated and torn, scarred 
and disfigured by the lash, I had these photo- 
graphs taken in the night, unknown to anyone 
except the victims themselves, who were, at my 
request, collected and assembled together for the 
purpose. I knew that these photographs would 
tell a tale of cruelty and inhumanity perpetrated 
by the owners of haciendas, which would be 
beyond cavil and dispute. 

The Peruvian Commissioner, who was sent out 
to China to negotiate a treaty with Viceroy Li 
Hung Chang to continue the coolie traffic to 
Peru, was still in Tientsin waiting for the arrival 
of my report. A friend of mine wrote me that 
he had the hardihood to deny the statements in 
my report, and said that they could not be sup- 
ported by facts. I had written to the Viceroy 
beforehand that he should hold the photographs 
in reserve, and keep them in the background till 
the Peruvian had exhausted all his arguments, 



196 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and then produce them. My correspondent wrote 
me that the Viceroy followed my suggestion, and 
the photographs proved to be so incontrovertible 
and palpable that the Peruvian was taken by 
surprise and was dumbfounded. He retired 
completely crestfallen. 

Since our reports on the actual conditions of 
Chinese coolies in Cuba and Peru were made, 
no more coolies have been allowed to leave China 
for those countries. The traffic had received its 
death blow. 



CHAPTER XIX 

END OF THE EDUCATIONAL 
MISSION 

In the fall of 1875 the last installment of stu- 
dents arrived. They came in charge of a new 
commissioner, Ou Ngoh Liang, two new 
Chinese teachers and a new interpreter, Kwang 
Kee Chen. These new men were appointed by 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang. I knew them in 
China, especially the new commissioner and the 
interpreter. 

These changes were made at the request of 
Chin Lan Pin, who expected soon to return to 
China on a leave of ahsence. He was going to 
take with him the old Chinese teacher, Yeh Shu 
Tung, who had rendered him great and signal 
service in his trip to Cuba on the coolie question 
the year before. Tsang Lai Sun, the old inter- 
preter, was also requested to resign and returned 
to China. These changes I had anticipated 
some time before and they did not surprise me. 

Three months after Chin Lan Pin's arrival in 

197 



198 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Peking, word came from China that he and I 
were appointed joint Chinese ministers to Wash- 
ington, and that Yeh Shu Tung, the old Chinese 
teacher, was appointed secretary to the Chinese 
Legation. This was great news to me to be sure, 
but I did not feel ecstatic over it; on the con- 
trary, the more I reflected on it, the more I felt 
depressed. But my friends who congratulated 
me on the honor and promotion did not take in 
the whole situation as it loomed up before my 
mind in all its bearings. As far as I was con- 
cerned, I had every reason to feel grateful and 
honored, but how about my life work the 
Chinese educational mission that I had in hand 
and which needed in its present stage great 
watchfulness and care? If, as I reflected, I were 
to be removed to Washington, who was there 
left behind to look after the welfare of the stu- 
dents with the same interest that I had manifest- 
ed ? It would be like separating the father from 
his children. This would not do, so I sat down 
and wrote to the Viceroy a letter, the tenor of 
which ran somewhat as follows : I thanked him 
for the appointment which I considered to be a 
great honor for any man to receive from the 
government; and said that while I appreciated 
fully its significance, the obligations and respon- 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 199 

sibilities inseparably connected with the position 
filled me with anxious solicitude that my abilities 
and qualifications might not be equal to their 
satisfactory fulfilment. In view of such a state 
of mind, I much preferred, if I were allowed to 
have my preference in the matter, to remain in 
my present position as a commissioner of the 
Chinese mission in Hartford and to continue 
in it till the Chinese students should have finished 
their education and were ready to return to 
China to serve the State in their various capaci- 
ties. In that event I should have discharged a 
duty to "Tsang the Upright," and at the same 
time fulfilled a great duty to China. As Chin 
Lan Pin had been appointed minister at the 
same time, he would doubtless be able alone to 
meet the expectations of the government in his 
diplomatic capacity. 

The letter was written and engrossed by Yung 
Yune Foo, one of the old Chinese teachers who 
came over with the first installment of students 
at the same time Yeh Shu Tung came. In less 
than four months an answer was received which 
partially acceded to my request by making me 
an assistant or associate minister, at the same 
time allowing me to retain my position as Com- 
missioner of Education, and in that capacity, to 



00 MY LIFE IN CHINA (AND AMERICA 

exercise a general supervision over the education 
of the students. 

Chi Ngoh Liang, the new commissioner, was a 
much younger man than Chin. He was a fair 
Chinese scholar, 'but not a member of the Hanlin 
College. He was doubtless recommended by 
Chin Lan Pin* He brought his family with him, 
which consisted of his second wife and two 
children. He was a man of a quiet disposition 
and showed no inclination to meddle with settled 
conditions or to create trouble, but took rather 
a philosophical view of things; he had the good 
sense to let well enough alone. He was connect- 
ed with the mission but a short time and resigned 
in 1876. 

In 1876 Chin Lan Pin came as minister pleni- 
potentiary and brought with him among his 
numerous retinue Woo Tsze Tung, a man whom 
I knew in Shanghai even in the ? 50's. He was a 
member of the Hanlin College, but for some 
reason or other, he was never assigned to any 
government department, nor was he ever known 
to hold any kind of government office. He 
showed a decided taste for chemistry, but never 
seemed to have made any progress in it, and was 
regarded by all his friends as a crank. 
After Ou's resignation, Chin Lan Pin before 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 201 

proceeding to Washington to take up Ms official 
position as Chinese minister, strongly recom- 
mended Woo Tsze Tung to succeed Ou as com- 
missioner, to which Viceroy Li Hung Chang 
acceded without thinking of the consequences to 
follow. From this time forth the educational 
mission found an enemy who was determined to 
undermine the work of Tsang Kwoh Fan and 
Ting Yih Cheong, to both of whom Woo Tsze 
Tung was more or less hostile. Woo was a mem- 
ber of the reactionary party, which looked upon 
the Chinese Educational Commission as a move 
subversive of .the principles and theories of 
Chinese culture. This was told me by one of 
Chin's suite who held the appointment of charge 
d'affaires for Peru. The making of Woo Tsze 
Tung a commissioner plainly revealed the fact that 
Chin Lan Pin himself was at heart an uncom- 
promising Confucian and practically represent- 
ed the reactionary party with all its rigid and 
uncompromising conservatism that gnashes its 
teeth against all and every attempt put forth to 
reform the government or to improve the general 
condition of things in China. This accounts for 
the fact that in the early stages of the mission, 
I had many and bitter altercations with him on 
many things which had to be settled for good, 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

once and for all. Such as the school and per- 
sonal expenses of the students; their vacation 
expenses; their change of costume; their attend- 
ance at family worship; their attendance at 
Sunday School and church services; their out- 
door exercises and athletic games. These and 
other questions of a social nature came up for 
settlement. I had to stand as a kind of buffer 
between Chin and the students, and defended 
them in all their reasonable claims. It was in 
this manner that I must have incurred Chin's 
displeasure if not his utter dislike. He had 
never been out of China in his life until he came 
to this country. The only standard by which 
he measured things and men (especially stu- 
dents) was purely Chinese. The gradual but 
marked transformation of the students in their 
behavior and conduct as they grew in knowledge 
and stature under New England influence, cul- 
ture and environment produced a contrast to 
their behavior and conduct when they first set 
foot in New England that might well be strange 
and repugnant to the ideas and senses of a man 
like Chin Lan Pin, who all his life had been 
accustomed to see the springs of life, energy and 
independence, candor, ingenuity and open- 
heartedness all covered up and concealed, and 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 203 

in a great measure smothered and never allowed 
their full play. Now in New England the heavy 
weight of repression and suppression was lifted 
from the minds of these young students; they 
exulted in their freedom and leaped for joy. No 
wonder they took to athletic sports with alacrity 
and delight! 

Doubtless Chin Lan Pin when he left Hart- 
ford for good to go to Washington carried away 
with him a very poor idea of the work to which 
he was singled out and called upon to perform. 
He must have felt that his own immaculate 
Chinese training had been contaminated by com- 
ing in contact with Occidental schooling, which 
he looked upon with evident repugnance. At 
the same time the very work which he seemed to 
look upon with disgust had certainly served him 
the best turn in his life. It served to lift him out 
of his obscurity as a head clerk in the office of 
the Board of Punishment for twenty years to 
become a commissioner of the Chinese Educa- 
tional Commission, and from that post to be a 
minister plenipotentiary in Washington. It 
was the stepping stone by which he climbed to 
political prominence. He should not have kicked 
away the ladder under him after he had reached 
his dizzy elevation. He did all he could to break 



204 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

up the educational scheme by recommending Woo 
Tsze Tung to be the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, than whom he could not have had a more 
pliant and subservient tool for his purpose, as 
may be seen hereinafter. 

Woo Tsze Tung was installed commissioner 
in the fall of 1876. No sooner was he in office 
than he began to find fault with everything that 
had been done. Instead of laying those com- 
plaints before me, he clandestinely started a 
stream of misrepresentation to Peking about the 
students; how they had been mismanaged; how 
they had been indulged and petted by Commis- 
sioner Yung; how they had been allowed to 
enjoy more privileges than was good for them; 
how they imitated American students in ath- 
letics; that they played more than they studied; 
that they formed themselves into secret societies, 
both religious and political; that they ignored 
their teachers and would not listen to the advice 
of the new commissioner; that if they were 
allowed to continue to have their own way, they 
would soon lose their love of their own country, 
and on their return to China, they would be good 
for nothing or worse than nothing; that most 
of them went to church, attended Sunday 
Schools and had become Christians; that the 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 205 

sooner this educational enterprise was broken up 
and all the students recalled, the better it would 
be for China, etc., etc. 

Such malicious misrepresentations and other 
falsehoods which we knew nothing of, were kept 
up in a continuous stream from year to year by 
Woo Tsze Tung to his friends in Peking and to 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang. The Viceroy called 
my attention to Woo's accusations. I wrote 
back in reply that they were malicious fabrica- 
tions of a man who was known to have been a 
crank all his life; that it was a grand mistake to 
put such a man in a responsible position who had 
done nothing for himself or for others in his life; 
that he was only attempting to destroy the work 
of Tsang Kwoh Fan who, by projecting and 
fathering the educational mission, had the highest 
interest of China at heart; whereas Woo should 
have been relegated to a cell in an insane asylum 
or to an institution for imbeciles. I said further 
that Chin Lan Pin, who had recommended Woo 
to His Excellency as commissioner of Chinese 
Education, was a timid man by nature and 
trembled at the sight of the smallest responsibil- 
ities. He and I had not agreed in our line of 
policy in our diplomatic correspondence with the 
State Department nor had we agreed as com- 



06 MY LIFE IN CHINA |AND AMERICA 

missioners in regard to the treatment of the 
Chinese students. To illustrate his extreme dis- 
like of responsibilities : He was requested by the 
Governor to go to Cuba to find out the condition 
of the coolies in that island in 1873. He waited 
three months before he started on his journey. 
He sent Yeh Shu Tung and one of the teachers 
of the Mission accompanied by a young Ameri- 
can lawyer and an interpreter to Cuba, which 
party did the burden of the work and thus paved 
the way for Chin Lan Pin and made the work 
easy for him. All he had to do was to take a 
trip down to Cuba and return, fulfilling his mis- 
sion in a perfunctory way. The heat of the day 
and the burden of the labor were all borne by 
Yeh Shu Tung, but Chin Lan Pin gathered in 
the laurel and was made a minister plenipoten- 
tiary, while Yeh was given the appointment of a 
secretary of the legation. I mention these things 
not from any invidious motive towards Chin, but 
simply to show that often in the official and 
political world one man gets more praise and 
glory than he really deserves, while another is 
not rewarded according to his intrinsic worth. 
His Excellency was well aware that I had no axe 
to grind in making the foregoing statement. I 
further added that I much preferred not to 



END OP EDUCATIONAL MISSION 207 

accept the appointment of a minister to Wash- 
ington, but rather to remain as commissioner of 
education, for the sole purpose of carrying it 
through to its final success. And, one time in the 
heat of our altercation over a letter addressed to 
the State Department, I told Chin Lan Pin in 
plain language that I did not care a rap either 
for the appointment of an assistant minister, or 
for that matter, of a full minister, and that I 
was ready and would gladly resign at any mo- 
ment, leaving him free and independent to do as 
he pleased. 

This letter in answer to the Viceroy's note 
calling my attention to Woo's accusations gave 
the Viceroy an insight into Woo's antecedents, 
as well as into the impalpable character of Chin 
Lan Pin. Li was, of course, in the dark as to 
what the Viceroy had written to Chin Lan Pin, 
but things both in the legation and the Mission 
apparently moved on smoothly for a while, till 
some of the students were advanced enough in 
their studies for me to make application to the 
State Department for admittance to the Mili- 
tary Academy at West Point and the Naval 
Academy in Annapolis. The answer to my 
application was: "There is no room provided for 
Chinese students/* It was curt and disdainful. 



208 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

It breathed the spirit of Kearnyism and Sand- 
lotism with which the whole Pacific atmosphere 
was impregnated, and which had hypnotized all 
the departments of the government, especially 
Congress, in which Elaine figured most conspic- 
uously as the champion against the Chinese on 
the floor of the Senate. He had the presiden- 
tial bee buzzing in his bonnet at the time, and did 
his best to cater for the electoral votes of the 
Pacific coast. The race prejudice against the 
Chinese was so rampant and rank that not only 
my application for the students to gain entrance 
to Annapolis and West Point was treated with 
cold indifference and scornful hauteur, but the 
Burlingame Treaty of 1868 was, without the least 
provocation, and contrary to all diplomatic 
precedents and common decency, trampled under 
foot unceremoniously and wantonly, and set aside 
as though no such treaty had ever existed, in or- 
der to make way for those acts of congressional 
discrimination against Chinese immigration 
which were pressed for immediate enactment. 

When I wrote to the Viceroy that I had met 
with a rebuff in my attempt to have some of the 
students admitted to West Point and Annapolis, 
his reply at once convinced me that the fate of 
the Mission was sealed. He too fell back on the 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 209 

Burlingame Treaty of 1868 to convince me that 
the United States government had violated the 
treaty by shutting out our students from West 
Point and Annapolis. 

Having given a sketch of the progress of the 
Chinese Educational Mission from 1870 to 1877- 
8, my letter applying for their admittance into 
the Military and Naval Academies might be re- 
garded as my last official act as a commissioner, 
My duties from 1878 onwards were chiefly con- 
fined to legation work. 

When the news that my application for the 
students to enter the Military and Naval Acad- 
emies of the government had proved a failure, 
and the displeasure and disappointment of the 
Viceroy at the rebuff were known, Commissioner 
Woo once more renewed his efforts to break up 
the Mission. This time he had the secret co- 
operation of Chin Lan Pin. Misrepresentations 
and falsehoods manufactured out of the whole 
cloth went forth to Peking in renewed budgets 
in every mail, till a censor from the ranks of 
the reactionary party came forward and took 
advantage of the strong anti-Chinese prejudices 
in America to memorialize the government to 
break up the Mission and have all the students 
recalled. 



210 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

The government before acceding to the me- 
morial put the question to Viceroy Li Hung 
Chang first, who, instead of standing up for the 
students, yielded to the opposition of the reac- 
tionary party and gave his assent to have the 
students recalled. Chin Lan Pin, who from his 
personal experience was supposed to know what 
ought to be done, was the next man asked to 
give his opinion. He decided that the students 
had been in the United States long enough, and 
that it was time for them to return to China. 
Woo Tsze Tung, the Commissioner, when asked 
for his opinion, came out point blank and said 
that they should be recalled without delay and 
should be strictly watched after their return. I 
was ruled out of the consultation altogether as 
being one utterly incompetent to give an impar- 
tial and reliable opinion on the subject. Thus 
the fate of the educational mission was sealed, 
and all students, about one hundred in all, re- 
turned to China in 1881. 

The breaking up of the Chinese Educational 
Commission and the recall of the young students 
in 1881, was not brought about without a strenu- 
ous effort on the part of some thoughtful men 
who had watched steadfastly over the develop- 
ment of human progress in the East and the 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 211 

West, who came forward in their quiet and mod- 
est ways to enter a protest against the revocation 
of the Mission. Chief among them were my life- 
long friend, the Rev. J. H. Twichell, and Rev, 
John W. Lane, through whose persistent efforts 
Presidents Porter and Seelye, Samuel Clemens, 
T. F. Frelinghuysen, John Russell Young and 
others were enlisted and brought forward to stay 
the work of retrogression of the part of the 
Chinese. The protest was couched in the most 
dignified, frank and manly language of President 
Porter of Yale and read as follows : 

To The Tsung Li Yamun 

or 
Office for Foreign Affairs. 

"The undersigned, who have been instructors, 
guardians and friends of the students who were 
sent to this country under the care of the Chinese 
Educational Commission, beg leave to represent: 

"That they exceedingly regret that these 
young men have been withdrawn from the coun- 
try, and that the Educational Commission has 
been dissolved. 

"So far as we have had opportunity to observe, 
and can learn from the representations of others, 



212 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the young men have generally made a faithful 
use of their opportunities, and have made good 
progress in the studies assigned to them, and in 
the knowledge of the language, ideas, arts and 
institutions of the people of this country. 

"With scarcely a single exception, their morals 
have been good; their manners have been singu- 
larly polite and decorous, and their behavior has 
been such as to make friends for themselves and 
their country in the families, the schools, the 
cities and villages in which they have resided. 

"In these ways they have proved themselves 
eminently worthy of the confidence which has 
been reposed in them to represent their families 
and the great Chinese Empire in a land of 
strangers. Though children and youths, they 
have seemed always to understand that the honor 
of their race and their nation was committed to 
their keeping. As the result of their good con- 
duct, many of the prejudices of ignorant and 
wicked men towards the Chinese have been 
removed, and more favorable sentiments have 
taken their place* 

"We deeply regret that the young men have 
been taken away just at the time when they were 
about to reap the most important advantages 
from their previous studies, and to gather in the 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 213 

rich harvest which their painful and laborious 
industry had been preparing for them to reap. 
The studies which most of them have pursued 
hitherto have been disciplinary and preparatory. 
The studies of which they have been deprived by 
their removal, would have been the bright flower 
and the ripened fruit of the roots and stems 
which have been slowly reared under patient 
watering and tillage. We have given to them 
the same knowledge and culture that we give to 
our own children and citizens. 

"As instructors and guardians of these young 
men, we should have welcomed to our schools 
and colleges the Commissioners of Education or 
their representatives and have explained to them 
our system and methods of instruction. In some 
cases, they have been invited to visit us, but have 
failed to respond to their invitations in person 
or by their deputies. 

"We would remind your honorable body that 
these students were originally received to our 
homes and our colleges by request of the Chinese 
government through the Secretary of State 
with the express desire that they might learn our 
language, our manners, our sciences and our 
arts. To remove them permanently and sud- 
denly without formal notice or inquiry on the 



214 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

ground that as yet they had learned nothing use- 
ful to China when their education in Western 
institutions, arts and sciences is as yet incom- 
plete, seems to us as unworthy of the great Em- 
pire for which we wish eminent prosperity and 
peace, as it is discourteous to the nation that 
extended to these young men its friendly hos- 
pitality. 

"We cannot accept as true the representation 
that they have derived evil and not good from 
our institutions, our principles and our manners. 
If they have neglected or forgotten their native 
language, we never assumed the duty of in- 
structing them in it, and cannot he held respon- 
sible for this neglect. The Chinese government 
thought it wise that some of its own youth should 
be trained after our methods. We have not 
finished the work which we were expected to 
perform. May we not reasonably be displeased 
that the results of our work should be judged 
unfavorably before it could possibly be finished? 

"In view of these considerations, and especial- 
ly in view of the injury and loss which have 
fallen upon the young men whom we have 
learned to respect and love, and the reproach 
which has implicitly been brought upon our- 
selves and the great nation to which we belong, 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 215 

we would respectfully urge that the reasons for 
this sudden decision should be reconsidered, and 
the representations which have heen made con- 
cerning the intellectual and moral character of 
our education should be properly substantiated. 
We would suggest that to this end, a committee 
may be appointed of eminent Chinese citizens 
whose duty it shall be to examine into the truth 
of the statements unfavorable to the young men 
or their teachers, which have led to the unexpect- 
ed abandonment of the Educational Commission 
and to the withdrawal of the young men from 
the United States before their education could 
be finished." 



CHAPTER XX 

JOURNEY TO PEKING AND DEATH 
OF MY WIFE 

The treatment which the students received at 
the hands of Chinese officials in the first years 
after their return to China as compared with the 
treatment they received in America while at 
school could not fail to make an impression upon 
their innermost convictions of the superiority 
of Occidental civilization over that of China 
an impression which will always appeal to them 
as cogent and valid ground for radical reforms 
in China, however altered their conditions may 
he in their subsequent careers. Quite a. number 
of the survivors of the one hundred students, I 
am happy to say, have risen to high official ranks 
and positions of great trust and responsibility. 
The eyes of the government have been opened 
to see the grand mistake it made in breaking 
up the Mission and having the students recalled. 
Within only a few years it had the candor and 
magnanimity to confess that it wished it had 

more of just such men as had been turned out 

216 



JOURNEY TO PEKING 217 

by the Chinese Educational Mission in Hart- 
ford, Conn. This confession, though coming too 
late, may be taken as a sure sign that China is 
really awakening and is making the best use of 
what few partially educated men are available. 
And these few Occidentally educated men have, 
in their turn, encouraged and stimulated both the 
government and the people. Since the memor- 
able events of the China and Japan war, and 
the war between Japan and Russia, several 
hundreds of Chinese students have come over to 
the United States to be educated. Thus the 
Chinese educational scheme which Tsang Kwoh 
Fan initiated in 1870 at Tientsin and established 
in Hartford, Conn., in 1872, though rolled back 
for a period of twenty-five years, has been prac- 
tically revived. 

Soon after the students' recall and return to 
China in 1881, I also took my departure and 
arrived in Tientsin in the fall of that year on my 
way to Peking to report myself to the govern- 
ment after my term of office as assistant minister 
had expired. This was the customary step for 
all diplomatic officers of the government to take 
at the close of their terms. Chin Lan Pin pre- 
ceded me by nearly a year, having returned in 
1880. 



218 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

While paying my visit to Li Hung Chang in 
Tientsin, before going up to Peking, he brought 
up the subject of the recall of the students* To 
my great astonishment he asked me why I had 
allowed the students to return to China. Not 
knowing exactly the significance of the inquiry, 
I said that Chin Lan Pin, who was minister, had 
received an imperial decree to break up the Mis- 
sion; that His Excellency was in favor of the 
decree, so was Chin Lan Pin and so was Woo 
Tsze Tung. If I had stood out alone against 
carrying out the imperial mandate, would not I 
have been regarded as a rebel, guilty of treason, 
and lose my head for it? But he said that at 
heart he was in favor of their being kept in the 
States to continue their studies, and that I ought 
to have detained them. In reply I asked how I 
could have been supposed to read his heart at $ 
distance of 45,000 lis, especially when it was well 
known that His Excellency had said that they 
might just as well be recalled. If His Excel- 
lency had written to me beforehand not to break 
up the Mission under any circumstances, I would 
then have known what to do; as it was, I could 
not have done otherwise than to see the decree 
carried out. "Well," said he, in a somewhat 
angry and excited tone, "I know the author of 



JOURNEY TO PEKING 219 

this great mischief " Woo Tsze Tung happened 
to be in Tientsin at the time. He had just been 
to Peking and sent me word begging me to call 
and see him. Out of courtesy, I did call. He 
told me he had not been well received in Peking, 
and that Viceroy Li was bitter towards him when 
he had called and had refused to see him a second 
time. He looked careworn and cast down. He 
was never heard of after our last interview. 

On my arrival in Peking, one of my first 
duties was to make my round of official calls on 
the leading dignitaries of the government the 
Princes Kung and Ching and the presidents of 
the six boards. It took me nearly a month to 
finish these official calls. Peking may be said 
to be a city of great distances, and the high 
officials live quite far apart from each other. 
The only conveyances that were used to go about 
from place to place were the mule carts. These 
were heavy, clumsy vehicles with an axle-tree run- 
ning right across under the body of a box, which 
was the carriage, and without springs to break 
the jolting, with two heavy wheels, one at each 
end of the axle. They were slow coaches, and 
with the Peking roads all cut up and seldom re- 
paired, you can imagine what traveling in those 
days meant. The dust and smell of the roads 



220 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

were something fearful. The dust was nothing 
but pulverized manure almost as black as ink. 
It was ground so fine by the millions of mule 
carts that this black stuff would fill one's eyes 
and ears and penetrate deep into the pores of 
one's skin, making it impossible to cleanse 
oneself with one washing. The neck, head and 
hands had to hare suitable coverings to keep off 
the dust. The water is brackish, making it diffi- 
cult to take off the dirt, thereby adding to the 
discomforts of living in Peking. 

I was in Peking about three months. While 
there, I found time to prepare a plan for the 
effectual suppression of the Indian opium trade 
in China and the extinction of the poppy cultiva- 
tion in China and India. This plan was submitted 
to the Chinese government to be carried out, but 
I was told by Whang Wen Shiu, the president 
of the Tsung Li Yamun (Foreign Affairs) , that 
for want of suitable men, the plan could not be 
entertained, and it was shelved for nearly a 
quarter of a century until recently when the sub- 
ject became an international question. 

I left Peking in 1882. After four months' 
residence in Shanghai, I returned to the United 
States on account of the health of my family. 

I reached home in the spring of 1883, and 



JOURNEY TO PEKING 221 

found my wife in a very low condition. She had 
lost the use of her voice and greeted me in a 
hoarse low whisper. I was thankful that I found 
her still living though much emaciated. In less 
than a month after my return, she began to pick 
up and felt more like herself. Doubtless, her 
declining health and suffering were brought on 
partly on account of my absence and her inex- 
pressible anxiety over the safety of my life. A 
missionary fresh from China happened to call 
on her a few days before my departure for China 
and told her that my going back to China was a 
hazardous step, as they would probably cut my 
head off on account of the Chinese Educational 
Mission. This piece of gratuitous information 
tended more to aggravate a mind already 
weighed down by poor health, and to have 
this gloomy foreboding added to her anxiety 
was more than she could bear. I was absent in 
China from my family this time nearly a year 
and a half, and I made up my mind that I would 
never leave it again under any conditions what- 
ever. My return in 1883 seemed to act on my 
wife's health and spirit like magic, as she grad- 
ually recovered strength enough to go up to 
Norfolk for the summer. The air up in Nor- 
folk was comparatively pure and more whole- 



82 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

some than in the Connecticut valley, and proved 
highly salubrious to her condition. At the close 
of the summer, she came back a different person 
from what she was when she went away, and I 
was much encouraged by her improved health. 
I followed up these changes of climate and air 
with the view of restoring her to her normal con- 
dition, taking her down to Atlanta, Georgia, 
one winter and to the Adirondacks another year. 
It seemed that these changes brought only 
temporary relief without any permanent recov- 
ery. In the winter of 1885, she began to show 
signs of a loss of appetite and expressed a desire 
for a change. Somerville, New Jersey, was 
recommended to her as a sanitarium. That was 
the last resort she went to for her health, for 
there she caught a cold which resulted in her 
death. She lingered there for nearly two months 
till she was brought home, and died of Bright's 
disease on the 28th of June, 1886. She was 
buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in the home lot 
I secured for that purpose. Her death made a 
great void in my after-life, which was irrepara- 
ble, but she did not leave me hopelessly deserted 
and alone; she left me two sons who are constant 
reminders of her beautiful life and character. 
They have proved to be my greatest comfort 



JOURNEY TO PEKING 223 

and solace in my declining years. They are most 
faithful, thoughtful and affectionate sons, and I 
am proud of their manly and earnest Christian 
characters. My gratitude to God for blessing 
me with two such sons will forever rise to heaven, 
an endless incense. 

The two blows that fell upon me one after the 
other within the short span of five years from 
1880 to 1886 were enough to crush my spirit. 
The one had scattered my life work to the four 
winds; the other had deprived me of a happy 
home which had lasted only ten years. The only 
gleam of light that broke through the dark 
clouds which hung over my head came from my 
two motherless sons whose tender years appealed 
to the very depths of my soul for care and sym- 
pathy. They were respectively seven and nine 
years old when deprived of their mother. I was 
both father and mother to them from 1886 till 
1895. My whole soul was wrapped up in their 
education and well-being. My mother-in-law, 
Mrs. Mary B. Kellogg, assisted me in my 
work and stood by me in my most trying hours, 
keeping house for me for nearly two years. 



CHAPTER XXI 
MY RECALL TO CHINA 

In 1894-5 war broke out between China and 
Japan on account of Korea. My sympathies 
were enlisted on the side of China, not because 
I am a Chinese, but because China had the right 
on her side, and Japan was simply trumping up 
a pretext to go to war with China, in order to 
show her military and naval prowess. Before 
the close of the war, it was impossible for me to 
be indifferent to the situation I could not 
repress my love for China. I wrote to my 
former legation interpreter and secretary, two 
letters setting forth a plan by which China might 
prosecute the war for an indefinite time. 

My first plan was to go over to London to 
negotiate a loan of $15,000,000, with which sum 
to purchase three or four ready built iron-clads, 
to raise a foreign force of 5,000 men to attack 
Japan in the rear from the Pacific coast thus 
creating a diversion to draw the Japanese forces 
from Korea and give the Chinese government a 
breathing spell to recruit a fresh army and a new 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 225 

navy to cope with Japan. While this plan was 
being carried out, the government was to em- 
power a commission to mortgage the Island of 
Formosa to some Western power for the sum of 
$400,000,000 for the purpose of organizing a 
national army and navy to carry on the war. 
These plans were embodied in two letters to Tsai 
Sik Yung, at that time secretary to Chang Tsze 
Tung, viceroy of Hunan and Hupeh. They 
were translated into Chinese for the Viceroy. 
That was in the winter of 1894. To my great 
surprise, Viceroy Chang approved of my first 
plan. I was authorized by cable to go over to 
London to negotiate the loan of $15,000,000. 
The Chinese minister in London, a Li Hung 
Chang man, was advised of my mission, which 
in itself was a sufficient credential for me to 
present myself to the minister. In less than a 
month after my arrival in London, I succeeded 
in negotiating the loan; but in order to furnish 
collaterals for it, I had to get the Chinese minis- 
ter in London to cable the government for the 
hypothecation of the customs' revenue. I was 
told that Sir Robert Hart, inspector-general of 
customs, and Viceroy Li Hung Chang refused 
to have the customs' revenue hypothecated, on 
the ground .that this revenue was hardly enough 



226 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

to cover as collateral the loan to meet the heavy 
indemnity demanded by Japan. The fact was: 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang and Chang Chi Tung 
were at loggerheads and opposed to each other in 
the conduct of the war. The latter was opposed 
to peace being negotiated by Li Hung Chang; 
but the former had the Dowager Empress on his 
side and was strenuous in his efforts for peace. 

Hence Sir Robert Hart had to side with the 
Court party, and ignored Chang Chi Tung's 
request for the loan of $15,000,000; on that 
account the loan fell through, and came near in- 
volving me in a suit with the London Banking 
Syndicate. 

I returned to New York and cabled for 
further instructions from Chang Chi Tung as to 
what my next step would be. In reply he cabled 
for me to come to China at once. 

After thirteen years of absence from China, 
I thought that my connections with the Chinese 
government had been severed for good when I 
left there in 1883. But it did not appear to be 
so; another call to return awaited me, this time 
from a man whom I had never seen, of whose 
character, disposition and views I was altogether 
ignorant, except from what I knew from hear- 
say. But he seemed to know all about me, and 



MY KECALL TO CHINA 237 

in his memorial to the government inviting me 
to return, he could not have spoken of me in 
higher terms than he did. So I girded myself 
to go back once more to see what there was in 
store for me. By this recall, I became Chang 
Chi Tung's man as opposed to Li Hung Chang. 
Before leaving for China this time, I took spe- 
cial pains to see my two sons well provided for in 
their education. Dr. E. W. Kellogg, my oldest 
brother-in-law, was appointed their guardian. 
Morrison Brown Yung, the older son, had just 
succeeded in entering Yale, Sheffield Scientific, 
and was able to look out for himself. Bartlett 
G. Yung, the younger one, was still in the Hart- 
ford High School preparing for college. I was 
anxious to secure a good home for him before 
leaving the country, as I did not wish to leave 
him to shift for himself at his critical age. The 
subject was mentioned to my friends, Mr. and 
Mrs. Twichell. They at once came forward and 
proposed to take Bartlett into their family as 
one of its members, till he was ready to enter 
college. This is only a single instance illus- 
trative of the large-hearted and broad spirit 
which has endeared them to their people both in 
the Asylum Hill church and outside of it. I was 
deeply affected by this act of self-denial and 



228 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

magnanimity in my behalf as well as in the 
behalf of my son Bartlett, whom I felt perfectly 
assured was in first-class hands, adopted as a 
member of one of the best families in New Eng- 
land. Knowing that my sons would be well 
cared for, and leaving the development of their 
characters to an all-wise and ever-ruling Provi- 
dence, as well as to their innate qualities, I 
embarked for China, this time without any defi- 
nite and specific object in view beyond looking 
out for what opening there might be for me to 
serve her* 

On my arrival in Shanghai, in the early part 
of the summer of 1895, I had to go to the 
expense of furnishing myself with a complete 
outfit of all my official dresses, which cost me 
quite a sum. Viceroy Chang Chi Tung, a short 
time previous to my arrival, had been transferred 
from the viceroyalty of the two Hoos to the 
viceroyalty of the two Kiangs temporarily. 
Instead of going up to Wu Chang, the capital 
of Hupeh, I went up to Nanking, where he was 
quartered. 

In Viceroy Chang Chi Tung, I did not find 
that magnetic attraction which at once drew me 
towards Tsang Kwoh Fan when I first met him 
at Ngan Khing in 1863. There was a cold, super- 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 229 

cilious air enveloping him, which at once put me 
on my guard. After stating in a summary way 
how the loan of $15,000,000 fell through, he did 
not state why the Peking government had de- 
clined to endorse his action in authorizing the loan, 
though I knew at the time that Sir Robert Hart, 
the inspector-general of the Chinese customs, 
put forward as an excuse that the custom dues 
were hardly enough to serve as collateral for the 
big loan that was about to be negotiated to 
satisfy the war indemnity demanded by the 
Japanese government. This was the diplomatic 
way of coating over a bitter pill for Chang Chi 
Tung to swallow, when the Peking government, 
through the influence of Li Hung Chang, was 
induced to ignore the loan. Chang and Li were 
not at the time on cordial terms, each having a 
divergent policy to follow in regard to the con- 
duct of the war. 

Dropping the subject of the loan as a dead 
issue, our next topic of conversation was the 
political state of the country in view of the 
humiliating defeat China had suffered through 
the incompetence and corruption of Li Hung 
Chang, whose defeat both on land and sea had 
stripped him of all official rank and title and 
came near costing him his life. I said that China, 



230 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

in order to recover her prestige and become a 
strong and powerful nation, would have to adopt 
a new policy. She would have to go to work and 
engage at least four foreigners to act as advisers 
in the Department for Foreign Affairs, in the 
Military and Naval Departments and in the 
Treasury Department. They might be engaged 
for a period of ten years, at the end of which time 
they might be re-engaged for another term. 
They would have to be men of practical expe- 
rience, of unquestioned ability and character. 
While these men were thus engaged to give their 
best advice in their respective departments, it 
should be taken up and acted upon, and young 
and able Chinese students should be selected to 
work under them. In that way, the government 
would have been rebuilt upon Western methods, 
and on principles and ideas that look to the 
reformation of the administrative government of 
China. 

Such was the sum and substance of my talk in 
the first and only interview with which Chang 
Chi Tung favored me. During the whole of it, 
he did not express his opinion at all on any of 
the topics touched upon. He was as reticent and 
absorbent as a dry sponge. The interview dif- 
fered from that accorded me by Tsang Kwoh 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 231 

Fan in 1863, in that Tsang had already made up 
his mind what he wanted to do for China, and 
I was pointed out to him to execute it. But in 
the case of Chang Chi Tung, he had no plan 
formed for China at the time, and what I pre- 
sented to him in the interview was entirely new 
and somewhat radical; but the close of the Japan 
War justified me in bringing forward such 
views, as it was on account of that war that I 
had been recalled. If he had been as broad a 
statesman as his predecessor, Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
he could have said something to encourage me to 
entertain even a glimpse of hope that he was 
going to do something to reform the political 
condition of the government of the country at 
the close of the war. Nothing, however, was 
said, or even hinted at. In fact, I had no other 
interview with him after the first one. Before 
he left Nanking for Wu Chang, he gave me the 
appointment of Secretary of Foreign Affairs for 
Kiang Nan. 

On the arrival of Liu Kwan Yih, the perma- 
nent viceroy of the two Kiang provinces, Chang 
Chi Tung did not ask me to go up to Wu Chang 
with him. This I took to lie a pretty broad hint 
that he did not need my services any longer, that 
I was not the man to suit his purposes ; and as I 



232 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

had no axe to grind, I did not make any attempt 
to run after my grind-stone. On the contrary, 
after three months' stay in Nanking under Vice- 
roy Liu Kwan Yih, out of regard for official eti- 
quette, I resigned the secretaryship, which was 
practically a sinecure paying about $150 a 
month. Such was my brief official experience 
with Viceroys Chang Chi Tung and Liu Kwan 
Yih. 

I severed my official connection with the 
provincial government of Kiang Nan in 1896, 
and took up my headquarters in Shanghai 
untrammeled and free to do as I pleased and 
go where I liked. It was then that I conceived 
the plan of inducing the central government to 
establish in Peking a government national bank. 
For this object I set to work translating into 
Chinese the National Banking Act and other 
laws relating to national banks from the 
Revised Statutes of the United States with 
Amendments and additional Acts of 1875. In 
prosecuting this work, I had the aid of a Chinese 
writer, likewise the co-operation of the late 
Wong Kai Keh, one of the Chinese students who 
was afterwards the assistant Chinese commis- 
sioner in the St. Louis Exposition, who gave me 
valuable help. With the translation, I went up 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 233 

to Peking with my Chinese writer, and, at the 
invitation of my old friend, Chang Yen Hwan, 
who had been Chinese Minister in Washington 
from 1884 to 1888, I took up my quarters in his 
residence and remained there several months. 
Chang Yen Hwan at that time held two offices : 
one as a senior member of the Tsung Li Yamun 
(Office for Foreign Affairs) ; the other, as the 
first secretary in the Treasury Department of 
which Ung Tung Hwo, tutor to the late 
Emperor Kwang Su, was the president, Chang 
Yen Hwan was greatly interested in the 
National Banking scheme* He examined the 
translation critically and suggested that I should 
leave out those articles that were inapplicable to 
the conditions of China, and retain only such 
as were important and practicable. After the 
translation and selection were completed, he 
showed it to Ung Tung Hwo, president of the 
Treasury. They were both highly pleased with 
it, and had all the Treasury officials look it over 
carefully and pass their judgment upon it. In 
a few weeks' time, the leading officials of the 
Treasury Department called upon me to con- 
gratulate me upon my work, and said it ought to 
be made a subject of a memorial to the govern- 
ment to have the banking scheme adopted and 



84 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

carried out. Chang Yen Hwan came forward to 
champion it, backed by Ung Tung Hwo, the 
president. 

To have a basis upon which to start the 
National Bank of China, it was necessary to 
have the government advance the sum of Tls. 
10,000,000; of this sum, upwards of Tls. 2,000,- 
000 were to be spent on machinery for printing 
government bonds and bank-notes of different 
denominations and machinery for a mint; Tls. 
2,000,000 for the purchase of land and buildings ; 
and Tls. 6,000,000 were to be held in reserve in 
the Treasury for the purchase of gold, silver and 
copper for minting coins of different denomina- 
tions for general circulation. This Tls. 10,000,000 
was to be taken as the initiatory sum to start the 
National Bank with, and was to be increased 
every year in proportion to the increase of the 
commerce of the Empire. 

We had made such progress in our project as 
to warrant our appointing a committee to go 
around to select a site for the Bank, while I was 
appointed to come to the United States to con- 
sult with the Treasury Department on the plan 
and scope of the enterprise and to learn the best 
course to take in carrying out the plan of the 
National Bank. The Treasury Department, 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 235 

through its president, Ung Tung Hwo 5 was on 
the point of memorializing for an imperial decree 
to sanction setting aside the sum of Tls. 
10,000,000 for the purpose indicated, when, to 
the astonishment of Chang Yen Hwan and other 
promoters of the enterprise, Ung Tung Hwo, 
the president, received a telegraphic message 
from Shing Sun Whei, head of the Chinese 
Telegraphic Co,, and manager of the Shanghai, 
China Steamship Navigation Co., asking Ung to 
suspend his action for a couple of weeks, till his 
arrival in Peking, Ung and Shing being inti- 
mate friends, besides being compatriots, Ung 
acceded to Shing's request. Shing Taotai, as 
he was called, was well-known to be a multi- 
millionaire, and no great enterprise or concession 
of any kind could pass through without his finger 
in the pie. So in this banking scheme, he was 
bound to have his say. He had emissaries all 
over Peking who kept him well posted about 
everything going on in the capital as well as 
outside of it. He had access to the most power- 
ful and influential princes in Peking, his system 
of graft reaching even the Dowager Empress 
through her favorite eunuch, the notorious Li 
Ling Ying. So Shing was a well-known 
character in Chinese politics. It was through 



236 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

his system of graft that the banking enterprise 
was defeated. It was reported that he came up 
to Peking with Tls. 300,000 as presents to two 
or three princes and other high and influential 
dignitaries, and got away with the Tls. 
10,000,000 of appropriation by setting up a bank 
to manipulate his own projects. 

The defeat of the National Banking project 
owed its origin to the thoroughly corrupt condi- 
tion of the administrative system of China. 
From the Dowager Empress down to the lowest 
and most petty underling in the Empire, the 
whole political fabric was honey-combed with 
what Americans characterize as graft a species 
of political barnacles, if I may be allowed to call 
it that, which, when once allowed to fasten their 
hold upon the bottom of the ship of State were 
sure to work havoc and ruination; in other words, 
with money one" could get anything done in 
China. Everything was for barter; the highest 
bid got the prize. The two wars the one with 
Japan in 1894-5 and the other, the Japan and 
Russian War in 1904-5 have in some measure 
purified the Eastern atmosphere, and the Chinese 
have finally awakened to their senses and have 
come to some sane consciousness of their actual 
condition. 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 237 

After the defeat of the national banking 
project at the hands of Shing Taotai, I went 
right to work to secure a railroad concession 
from the government. The railroad I had in 
mind was one between the two ports of Tien- 
tsin and Chinkiang; one in the north, the other 
in the south near the mouth of the Yangtze 
River, The distance between these ports in a 
bee line is about five hundred miles; by a 
circuitous route going around the province 
of Shan Tung and crossing the Yellow 
River into the province of Hunan through 
Anwhui, the distance would be about seven 
hundred miles. The German government 
objected to having this railroad cross Shan 
Tung province, as they claimed they had 
the monopoly of building railroads throughout 
the province, and would not allow another party 
to build a railroad across Shan Tung. This was 
a preposterous and absurd pretension and could 
not be supported either by the international 
laws or the sovereign laws of China* At that 
time, China was too feeble and weak to take up 
the question and assert her own sovereign rights 
in the matter, nor had she the men in the Foreign 
Office to show up the absurdity of the pretension. 
So, to avoid any international complications, the 



238 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

concession was issued to me with the distinct 
understanding that the road was to be built by 
the circuitous route above described. The road 
was to be built with Chinese, not with foreign 
capital. I was given six months' time to secure 
capital* At the end of six months, if I failed to 
show capital, I was to surrender the concession. 
I knew very well that it would be impossible to 
get Chinese capitalists to build any railroad at 
that time. I tried hard to get around the stick- 
ing point by getting foreign syndicates to take 
over the concession, but all my attempts proved 
abortive, and I was compelled to give up my rail- 
road scheme also. This ended my last effort to 
help China. 

I did not dream that in the midst of my work, 
Khang Yu Wei and his disciple, Leang Kai 
Chiu, whom I met often in Peking during the 
previous year, were engaged in the great work of 
reform which was soon to culminate in the 
momentous coup d'etat of 1898. 



CHAPTER XXII 
THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 

The coup d'etat of September, 1898, was an 
event memorable in the annals of the Manchu 
Dynasty. In it, the late Emperor Kwang Su 
was arbitrarily deposed; treasonably made a 
prisoner of state; and had his prerogatives and 
rights as Emperor of the Chinese Empire 
wrested from him and usurped by the late 
Dowager Empress Chi HsL 

Kwang Su, though crowned Emperor when 
he was five years of age, had all along held the 
sceptre only nominally. It was Chi Hsi who 
held the helm of the government all the time. 

As soon as Kwang Su had attained his ma- 
jority, and began to exercise his authority as 
emperor, the lynx eye of Chi Hsi was never 
lifted away from him. His acts and movements 
were watched with the closest scrutiny, and were 
looked upon in any light but the right one, 
because her own stand in the government had 
never been the legitimate and straight one since 

1864, when her first regency over her own son, 

239 



240 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Tung Chi, woke in her an ambition to dominate 
and rule, which grew to he a passion too morhid 
and strong to be curbed. 

In the assertion of his true manhood, and the 
exercise of his sovereign power, his determina- 
tion to reform the government made him at once 
the cynosure of Peking, inside and outside of 
the Palace, In the eyes of the Dowager Em- 
press Chi Hsi, whose retina was darkened by 
deeds perpetrated in the interest of usurpation 
and blinded by jealousy, Kwang Su appeared in 
no other light than as a dement, or to use a milder 
expression, an imbecile, fit only to be tagged 
round by an apron string, cared for and watched. 
But to the disinterested spectator and unpreju- 
diced judge, Kwan Su was no imbecile, much 
less a dement. Impartial history and posterity 
will pronounce him not only a patriot emperor, 
but also a patriot reformer as mentally sound and 
sane as any emperor who ever sat on the throne 
of China. He may be looked upon as a most 
remarkable historical character of the Manchu 
Dynasty from the fact that he was singled out 
by an all-wise Providence to be the pioneer of 
the great reform movement in China at the 
threshold of the twentieth century. 

Just at this juncture of the political condition 



THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 

of China, the tide of reform had reached Peking. 
Emperor Kwang Su, under some mysterious in- 
fluence, to the astonishment of the world, stood 
forth as the exponent of this reform movement. 
I determined to remain in the city to watch its 
progress. My headquarters became the rendez- 
vous of the leading reformers of 1898. It was in 
the fall of that memorable year that the coup 
d'etat took place, in which the young Emperor 
Kwang Su was deposed by the Dowager 
Empress, and some of the leading reformers 
arrested and summarily decapitated. 

Being implicated by harboring the reformers, 
and in deep sympathy with them, I had to flee 
for my own life and succeeded in escaping from 
Peking. I took up quarters in the foreign set- 
tlement of Shanghai. While there, I organized 
the "Deliberative Association of China," of 
which I was chosen the first president. The 
object of the association was to discuss the lead- 
ing question of the day, especially those of re- 
form. 

In 1899, I was advised for my own personal 
safety, to change my residence. I went to Hong 
Kong and placed myself under the protection of 
the British government. 

I was in Hong Kong from 1900 till 1902, 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

when I returned to the United States to see my 
younger son, Bartlett G. Yung, graduate from 
Yale University* 

In the spring of 1901, I visited the Island of 
Formosa, and in that visit I called upon Vis- 
count Gentaro Kodama, governor of the island, 
who, in the Russo-Japan War of 1904-5 was 
the chief of staff to Marshal Oyama in Man- 
churia. In the interview our conversation had 
to be carried on through his interpreter, as he, 
Kodama, could not speak English nor could I 
speak Japanese. 

He said he was glad to see me, as he had heard 
a great deal of me, but never had the pleasure of 
meeting me. Now that he had the opportuity, 
he said he might as well tell me that he had most 
unpleasant if not painful information to give me. 
Being somewhat surprised at such an announce- 
ment, I asked what the information was. He said 
he had received from the viceroy of Fuhkein and 
Chehkiang an official despatch requesting him to 
have me arrested, if found in Formosa, and sent 
over to the mainland to be delivered over to the 
Chinese authorities. Kodama while giving this 
information showed neither perturbation of 
thought nor feeling, but his whole countenance 
was wreathed with a calm and even playful smile. 



THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 243 

I was not disturbed by this unexpected news, 
nor was I at all excited. I met it calmly and 
squarely, and said in reply that I was entirely in 
his power, that he could deliver me over to my 
enemies whenever he wished; I was ready to die 
for China at any time, provided that the death 
was an honorable one. 

"Well, Mr. Yung," said he, "I am not going 
to play the part of a constable for China, so 
you may rest at ease on this point. I shall not 
deliver you over to China. But I have another 
matter to call to your attention." I asked what 
it was. He immediately held up a Chinese news- 
paper before me, and asked who was the author 
of the proposition. Without the least hesi- 
tation. I told him I was the author of it. 
At the same time, to give emphasis to this 
open declaration, I put my opened right palm 
on my chest two or three times, which attracted 
the attention of everyone in the room, and caused 
a slight excitement among the Japanese officials 
present. 

I then said, "With Your Excellency's per- 
mission, I must beg to make one correction in 
the amount stated; instead of $800,000,000, the 
sum stated in my proposition was only $400,- 
000,000." At this frank and open declaration 



244 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and the corrected sum, Kodama was evidently 
pleased and visibly showed his pleasure by smil- 
ing at me. 

The Chinese newspaper Kodama showed me 
contained a proposition I drew up for Viceroy 
Chang Chi Tung to memorialize the Peking 
government for adoption in 1894-5, about six 
months before the signing of the Treaty of 
Shemonashiki by Viceroy Li Hung Chang. 
The proposal was to have the Island of Formosa 
mortgaged to a European Treaty power for a 
period of ninety-nine years for the sum of 
$400,000,000 in gold. With this sum China was 
to carry on the war with Japan by raising a new 
army and a new navy. This proposition was 
never carried through, but was made public in 
the Chinese newspapers, and a copy of it found 
its way to Kodama's office, where, strange to say, 
I was confronted with it, and I had the moral 
courage not only to avow its authorship but also 
a correction of the amount the island was to be 
mortgaged for. 

To bring the interview to a climax, I said, 
should like circumstances ever arise, nothing 
would deter me from repeating the same propo- 
sition in order to fight Japan. 

This interview with the Japanese governor of 



THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 245 

Formosa was one of the most memorable ones in 
my life. I thought at first that at the request of 
the Chinese viceroy I was going to be sur- 
rendered, and that my fate was sealed; but no 
sooner had the twinkling smile of Kodama 
lighted his countenance than my assurance of life 
and safety came back with redoubled strength, 
and I was emboldened to talk war on Japan with 
perfect impunity. The bold and open stand I 
took on that occasion won the admiration of the 
governor who then invited me to accompany him 
to Japan where he expected to go soon to 
be promoted. He said he would introduce me to 
the Japanese emperor and other leading men of 
the nation. I thanked him heartily for his 
kindness and invitation and said I would accept 
such a generous invitation and consider it a great 
honor to accompany him on his contemplated 
journey, but my health would not allow me to 
take advantage of it. I had the asthma badly 
at the time. 

Then, before parting, he said that my life was 
in danger, and that while I was in Formosa 
under his jurisdiction he would see that I was 
well protected and said that he would furnish 
me with a bodyguard to prevent all possibilities 
of assassination. So the next day he sent me 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

four Japanese guards to watch over me at night 
in my quarters; and in the daytime whenever I 
went out, two guards would go in advance of 
me and two behind my jinrickisha to see that I 
was safe. This protection was continued for 
the few days I spent in Formosa till I em- 
barked for Hong Kong. I went in person to 
thank the governor and to express my great 
obligation and gratitude to him for the deep 
interest he had manifested towards me. 



APPENDIX 

An address by the Rev. Joseph H. Twichell, delivered 
before the Kent Club of the Yale Law School, April 10, 
1878. 

A visitor to the City of Hartford, at the pres- 
ent time, will be likely to meet on the streets 
groups of Chinese boys, in their native dress, 
though somewhat modified, and speaking their 
native tongue, yet seeming, withal, to be very 
much at home. He will also occasionally meet 
Chinese men who, by their bearing, will impress 
him as being gentlemen of their race. 

These gentlemen are officers, and these boys 
are pupils of the Chinese Educational Mission, 
although one of the most remarkable and signifi- 
cant institutions of the age on the face of the 
whole earth. The object of the mission, now of 
nearly six years' standing, is the education in 
this country, through a term of fifteen years, of 
a corps of young men for the Chinese Govern- 
ment service; that Government paying the whole 
cost an annual expense of about $100,000. The 
number of the officers is five, viz, the two Im- 
perial Commissioners in charge, a translator and 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

interpreter and two teachers. The function of 
the teachers is to direct the Chinese education of 
the pupils, which proceeds pan passu with their 
Western education. The number of pupils was 
originally 120, but now 112, one having died 
and seven having, for various reasons, returned 
to China. A fine, large house recently erected 
by the Chinese Government in the western part 
of the City, at a cost of fifty thousand dollars, 
is the headquarters of the Mission. There are 
the offices of the officers, and there is lodged the 
class that is present for examination and instruc- 
tion in Chinese studies. For this purpose the 
pupils are divided into classes of about twenty, 
one coming as another goes, each staying at the 
Mission House two weeks at a time. A small 
part only of the whole number are permanently 
located in Hartford. Most of them are in other 
places, though not far away, generally two to- 
gether -attending school or receiving private in- 
struction in families. 

They come in yearly companies of thirty, be- 
ginning with 1872, and the last detachment is 
still chiefly engaged in learning our language. 

The plan is to afford these boys the advantages 
of our best educational institutions academies, 
colleges, and, to some extent, professional schools 



APPENDIX 249 

to assign them, by and by, as they shall develop 
aptitude, to various special courses of study and 
training in the physical, mechanical and military 
sciences, in political history and economy, inter- 
national law, the principles and practice of civil 
administration and in all departments and 
branches of knowledge, skill in which is useful 
for public government service in these modern 
times. And through the whole process of this 
education, it is to be impressed upon them that 
they belong and are to belong to their nation, 
for whose sake they are elected to enjoy these 
great and peculiar opportunities. The result 
will be, if all goes well and the plan is carried 
out, and there is apparently nothing now to 
prevent it, that in the year 1887 or thereabout 
there will go from this country to China a body 
of somewhere near a hundred men who have 
grown up under exceedingly favorable condi- 
tions from early youth to manhood here among 
us, destined to hold places of importance in the 
government and in the society of their native 
land, better equipped in all save experience to 
do for that land what most needs to be done, 
and inspired for their work with a more enlight- 
ened sense of patriotic duty and responsibility 
than any other hundred of her sons of their 



250 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

generation. And who can forecast or estimate 
the consequences that Divine Providence is thus 



preparing? 



COMMISSIONER YUNG WING 

Such in brief outline is the Chinese Educa- 
tional Mission to the United States. The head 
and front of the whole marvellous enterprise, 
humanly speaking, is Commissioner Yung Wing. 
While others whose cooperation was indispensa- 
ble, have, as will presently appear, contributed 
to it and still stand back of it, and justly share 
the credit of it with him, to him more than to 
any other man beside, probably more than to 
all other men beside, its existence is due. Its 
history, thus far, cannot be better told except in 
that connection, so intimately -are the two his- 
tories related. But it becomes one who speaks 
of Yung Wing to observe the principle that we 
must be modest for a modest man, for so modest 
a man as he is is rare to find. He was born in 
1828, of a worthy family in humble life, near the 
city of Macao in Southern China. In the year 
1839 he became a pupil in a children's school, 
opened by Mrs. Gutzlaff, the wife of an English 
missionary, his parents consenting to it in the 



APPENDIX 251 

Idea that it would be a profitable thing for him to 
learn the English language. Proving a bright 
scholar, he was in time promoted to the Morrison 
School, an institution founded by English mer- 
chants in Macao and named after Robert Morri- 
son, the first English Protestant, but at this 
time under charge of the Rev. S. R. Brown, a 
teacher engaged by the Morrison Educational 
Society. When later this school was transferred 
to Hong Kong he went with it, and remained 
in it till he came to this country. He suffered, 
however, during this time serious interruption by 
the death of his father, which required him to 
go home and, a boy that he was, assist in the 
support of his family. This he did by wages 
earned in the printing establishment of a Portu- 
guese Roman Catholic mission in Macao. 

In 1847, Mr. Brown, who had long noted his 
patient ardor in study, the marks of ability he 
showed and a certain original vigor of will and 
strength of character that were in him, brought 
him, at the age of sixteen, with two other native 
lads, also his pupils, of about the same age, to 
the United States; Andrew Shortrede, a large- 
hearted Scotchman, founder, proprietor and edi- 
tor of The China Mail, published at Hong 
Kong, engaging to advance the means of their 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

support for two years. The three boys were 
entered together at the academy in Monson, 
Mass., and were received into the family of Mr. 
Brown's mother, who lived at Monson, a royal 
woman whose name is memorable in the church 
of Christ as that of the author of the hymn, "I 
love to steal awhile away/' It was while a mem- 
ber of her godly household that Yung Wing 
became a Christian believer. 

It will not be out of place to state here, as a 
fact, the significance of which will be readily 
appreciated, that he caused the son who was born 
to him in 1876 his first-born to be named in 
baptism Morrison Brown, an eloquent act of 
recognition and profession. Of Wing's two com- 
panions one, Wong Shing, was compelled, by 
want of health, to return to China the next year. 
There, in the office of The China Mail,, he 
learned the art of printing. From 1852 or 1853 
he was for several years connected with the press 
of the London Mission under Dr. Legge, now 
the eminent Professor of the Chinese Language 
and Literature in Oxford University. In 1873 
he accompanied the second detachment of 
Chinese students to this country, and is at pres- 
ent under appointment as interpreter to the 
Chinese Legation soon to be established at Wash- 
ington. 



APPENDIX 53 

The other, Wong Fun, went to Scotland in 
1850, and after two years general study entered 
the Medical Department of Edinburgh Univer- 
sity, at which he graduated with very high honor. 
Returning to China in 1856, he hegan the prac- 
tice of medicine in the city of Canton and is most 
highly esteemed on all that coast, both for his 
private character and for his professional talents, 
being held by many foreign residents the ablest 
physician in the whole region of the East beyond 
Calcutta. Wong Fun died Oct. 15th, 1878. 

IN YALE COLLEGE 

Yung Wing, after two years and a half spent 
iat Monson, Mass., was, in 1850, though but 
poorly fitted for want of time, admitted to the 
Freshman Class in Yale College. His career in 
college was, in some respects, a remarkable one. 
Owing to his inadequate preparations, he did not, 
though he worked hard, take a high stand in 
general scholarship, yet he excelled in the de- 
partments of writing and metaphysics, and 
made a sensation that was felt beyond the col- 
lege walls by bearing off repeated prizes for 
English composition. Throughout his entire 
course he contended with poverty, a circumstance 



254 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the explanation of which deserves notice. When 
he became a Christian, at Monson, he heard and 
at once accepted his Divine call to devote his 
life to the Christian service of his nation. But 
the form of that service what should it he? 
This question he had to answer, at least in part. 
The presumption was, and it was assumed by 
Ms friends and by the public so far as his case 
was known, that he would be a minister of the 
Gospel. But right then and there, after much 
careful and prayerful thinking, this boy of 
seventeen, though by no means doubting the 
value of Christian missions, fully recognizing 
the fact, indeed, that he himself was the direct 
fruit of Christian missions, which, be it ever 
remembered, he was, concluded, with an inde- 
pendence characteristic of him even at that age, 
that it was not best for him to be a missionary. 
He had a suspicion then, though indistinct, that 
he was wanted for something else. It was a 
costly conclusion and he was quite aware of it. 
It was against the views and hopes of the most 
of those who were around him, and by it, being 
without pecuniary means, he cut himself off from 
the resource of those charitable foundations that 
would have aided him as a student for the minis- 
try. And so he was poor in college; he smiles 



APPENDIX 255 

now to remember how poor. Yet he received 
help from persons interested in him; at New 
Haven and elsewhere, mainly through the 
medium of Professor Thatcher,, whose care for 
him in that matter claims his liveliest gratitude 
to this day. And he got through. He came to 
college in his cue and Chinese tunic, hut put off 
both in the course of his first year* 

His nationality made him a good deal of a 
stranger, and this, together with his extreme 
natural reserve and his poverty, kept him from 
mingling much with the social life of college. 
He had not many intimates, yet he so carried 
himself from first to last as to merit and win the 
entire respect of all his class. It was in certain 
long walks and talks he had with his classmate, 
Carrol Cutler, now president of Western Re- 
serve College, that he opened and discussed the 
project then forming in his mind of this Chinese 
Educational Mission. The idea was born, the 
dream was taking shape, but the way was long 
to its realization. 

His graduation in 1854 was the event of the 
Commencement of that year. There were many, 
at least, who so regarded it, and some of them 
came to the Commencement principally for the 
sake of seeing the Chinese graduate. Among 



256 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the latter was Dr. Bushnell of Hartford. He 
had heard of him and being strongly interested, 
according to the size of his great mind and heart, 
in the Chinese race, he desired to meet Yung 
Wing. An incident of their meeting on that 
occasion, which the writer has heard Dr. Bush- 
nell tell, will bear repeating: When they were 
introduced, the Doctor gave it as one of his 
reasons for seeking the introduction that he de- 
sired to ascertain who had written certain news- 
paper articles on the Chinese question, as it then 
stood, which had attracted his attention as evinc- 
ing marks of statesmanship. He thought Wing 
might know. Whereupon, as the Doctor said, 
Wing hung his head, and blushing like a girl, 
with much confusion of manner, confessed that 
he was their author. It is only fair to add that 
Mr, Wing says that he does not remember this 
incident. But it is equally fair to add again 
that in a case of this kind Dr. BushnelTs memory, 
or anybody else's, were more worthy to be 
trusted than Yung Wing's. 

At the time of his graduation, Wing was as 
much tempted as it was possible for him to be, 
to change the plan of his life. He had been in 
this country long enough to becom'e thoroughly 
naturalized here. He was, in fact, a citizen. All 



APPENDIX 257 

his tastes and feelings and affinities, intellectual 
and moral, made him at home here. Moreover, 
through the notice into which his graduation 
brought him, it came about that a very inviting 
opportunity was opened to him to remain and 
have his career here if he chose to. On the other 
hand, China was like a strange land to him. He 
had even almost entirely forgotten his native 
tongue. And there was nothing in China for 
him to go to. Except among his humble kindred, 
he had no friends there; nothing to give him any 
standing or consideration, no place, so to speak, 
to set his foot on. Not only so, but considering 
where he had been and what he had become, and 
the purpose he had in view, he could not fail to 
encounter, among his own people, prejudice, 
suspicion, hostility. A cheerless, forbidding 
prospect lay before him in that direction. The 
thought of going back was the thought of exile. 
He wanted immensely to stay. But there was 
one text of Holy Scripture that, all this while, 
he says, haunted Mm and followed him like the 
voice of God. It was this: "If any provide not 
for his own, and specially for those of his own 
house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than 
an infidel." And by the words "his own" and 
"his own house," it meant to him the nation of 



258 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

which he was born. The text carried the day. 
The benefits which he had been, as it were, 
singled out from a whole people to receive, his 
sense of justice and gratitude alike would not 
let him appropriate to his own advantage. And 
so, though he knew not what should befall him, 
he set his face to return; and he went to do what 
he has done. 

He sailed soon after his graduation for Hong 
Kong which, after a voyage of 151 days, he 
reached in the month of April, 1855. When the 
Chinese pilot came on board he found that he 
could, with some difficulty, understand what he 
said, though he could not make the pilot under- 
stand him, which shows the condition of his 
knowledge of Chinese on his arrival in the 
country. It took him! all the time he was not 
otherwise employed for two years to acquire 
facility in the use of it. 

TAKING FIRST STEPS IN LIFE 

As for his grand scheme, he had settled it in 
his own mind that the first step to be taken 
toward carrying it out was to contrive a way 
of getting it before some influential public man 
or men a thing itself of infinite difficulty. 



APPENDIX 259 

With this end in view, though, of course, to make 
his living also, he sought and obtained the posi- 
tion of private secretary to the Hon. Peter Par- 
ker, then Commissioner of the United States to 
China, hoping that it would be the means of 
affording him the access he desired. Becoming 
satisfied upon a sufficient trial that it was not 
likely to answer his expectations in this regard, 
he resigned the place after a few months. He 
now attempted another way of compassing the 
matter. There was at Hong Kong an English 
bar consisting of a dozen or so lawyers doing 
business for the foreign commercial houses of 
that City. Wing bethought him that the stand- 
ing and acquaintance resulting from his becom- 
ing a member of that bar might not improbably 
bring him the opportunity he sought. Accord- 
ingly, he entered one of the offices as a student. 
But presently it got out among the lawyers who 
this young man was, what his education had 
been, and they saw that his competition with 
them for legal practice of a Chinese city was a 
thing not to be allowed if it could be prevented. 
And so his principal, pleading the commands 
of his legal brethren, informed him, with many 
courteous expressions of regret, that he must 
find another place to study law in. And as 



260 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

there was no other place, he had to give it up. 

After this followed an interval of nearly two 
years, during which he occupied himself with 
Chinese and other studies, earning his bread by 
such commercial translation as he could find to 
do, and waited for the right thing to turn up. 
He then, in the same hope that led him to his 
previous experiments, took a place in the Cus- 
toms Service at Shanghai. But neither did this, 
on trial, promise, in his judgment, a pou sto 
for his operations, and he soon abandoned it. 

It was now 1860. Five years and nothing 
accomplished! To one only looking on the out- 
side Yung Wing would appear to have thus 
far pursued an uncertain and rather thriftless 
course; but not if he penetrated his real policy 
and the purpose that lay ever nearest his heart; 
most assuredly not if he knew what was the 
fact that all this time that he was going from 
one thing to another and keeping himself poor, 
he was refusing offers of employment at rates 
of remuneration that to him, so long familiar 
with a straightened lot, seemed little short of 
princely. In 1860, however, overtures were 
made him by one of the leading silk and tea 
houses of Shanghai to enter its service as travel* 
ing inland agent, which, for the reason in part 



APPENDIX 261 

that it would send him touring through a wide 
extent of country and possess him, by observa- 
tion, of a knowledge that he deemed would be 
useful to him, he determined to accept. This 
business he followed for a year, and then, seeing 
a good chance for it, set up in a business for 
himself which proved so profitable a venture that, 
had he continued in it, he would, to all appear- 
ances, have speedily become rich. As it was, he 
made a very considerable sum of money* 

But in 1862 the door of the opportunity which 
he had been constantly feeling after from the 
day he landed in China, unexpectedly opened to 
him. 

It was in this wise: While in the city of 
Shanghai, he made the acquaintance of a Chinese 
astronomer a man of rank and of eminence in 
learning. Or rather, the astronomer, who had 
in some way gained intelligence of Wing's ante- 
cedents, sought his acquaintance for the sake of 
talking astronomy with him. In repeated inter- 
views through which their acquaintance pro- 
gressed to the degree of mutual friendly regard, 
Wing, who had carried away from college a 
better knowledge of astronomy than most gradu- 
ates do, told him all he knew, which was a long 
advance upon his own previous acquisitions in 



26 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

that science. This astronomer was an officer of 
the great Tsang Kwoh Fan, viceroy of Kiang Su 
and Kiang Nan provinces, generalissimo of the 
Imperial forces and one of the very most promi- 
nent and leading men in the whole Empire. 
Through representations made to him by the 
astronomer, he soon sent a message to Yung 
Wing desiring to see him, and hinting a desire to 
take him into his service. Though returning a 
favorable reply to the message, under all the 
circumstances and for reasons that cannot be 
explained, Wing delayed responding to it in 
person for a considerable time. The situation 
was a delicate one, requiring extreme caution 
and circumspection on his part. 

But at length he paid Tsang Koh Fan the 
promised visit. He felt the occasion to be a 
critical one, and when ushered into the great 
man's presence found it difficult to retain his 
composure. Tsang Koh Fan first bent upon 
him a long, intense, piercing gaze. As Wing 
says, he had never been looked at in his life as 
he was then. Then causing him to be seated, he 
required of him an account of his history, which 
he gave. He then questioned him as to his views 
respecting China, her needs, her outlook, her 
public policy, and so on. A long conversation 



APPENDIX 263 

followed in which the Viceroy disclosed his views, 
to which Wing listened with amazement. For, 
behold, here was a man such as he had not sup- 
posed existed in that country a man reared in 
China, and not a young man either who had 
light in his head; who recognized the causes of 
many of the disadvantages China was contending 
with in taking her place among the family of 
nations; a man of marvellously liberal and pro- 
gressive sentiments. 

MADE A MANDAHIN 

The result of the interview was that Wing 
entered his service and was made a Mandarin 
of the fifth rank, there being nine degrees of that 
dignity in the Chinese official system, At this 
time the great Taiping rebellion was at its height 
and Tsang Koh Fan was in the field. In fact, 
the interview had taken place at his camp in 
Ngankin, on the Yang Tse River, The Viceroy 
first tendered Wing a military command which, 
on the score of lack of qualification, he asked 
leave to decline. He was then, shortly after, 
1864, at his own suggestion, despatched abroad 
to purchase machinery for the manufacture of 
arms, for which purpose the expenditure of a 



264 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

large sum of money was intrusted to him. On 
this errand he visited France and England as 
well as the United States, but finally gave his 
orders here. On returning with his purchases 
to China in 1865, what he had done was so satis- 
factory to his chief that he was advanced to the 
next higher grade of official rank, viz, the 
Fourth. The machinery he had bought was the 
foundation of the Kiang Nan Arsenal. It is 
curious to remark that the first work of a man 
whose supreme ambition it was, from Christian 
motives, to set his country forward in civilization, 
should have been the establishment of an arsenaL 
But it quite consisted with Yung Wing's ideas, 
which were intensely patriotic. 

From 1865 to 1870 he was variously employed 
in different places, being under command now 
of one superior and now of another. Among 
the work that he did during this period, that of 
translation was prominent. He translated into 
Chinese Parson's Law of Contracts, and a book 
of English Law. He also translated large por- 
tions of Colton's Geography, deeming that 
geographical knowledge was as likely to prove 
beneficial to his countrymen as any. 

But the thing that lay nearest his heart and 
that was continually before him, was the question 



APPENDIX 65 

of how to accomplish the plan he had so many 
years held in hope. He now had ample oppor- 
tunity to expound and advocate it, and he did 
so with inexhaustible perseverance. The main 
argument he used was this : China, in her inter- 
national relations, in her commercial and other 
intercourse with foreign peoples, suffers disad- 
vantage and much detriment from want of men 
capable by education of acting as her representa- 
tives. She is forced to employ in many most 
important places, that ought to be occupied by 
her own citizens, foreigners by whom her inter- 
ests are liable to be neglected or betrayed. Her 
forts, her ships of war, her military forces, her 
customs, are largely in charge of foreigners. 
How was it proper, he asked, that Anson Bur- 
lingame, an American, should be her chief agent 
in arranging a treaty with his own country and 
other western governments? This was his gen- 
eral line of reasoning. 

The most to whom he brought the matter 
heard him with indifference, but there were three 
men upon whom he made an impression all men 
of high rank and commanding influence. They 
were the Viceroy, Tsang Koh Fan, already 
named; Li Hung Chang, now Viceroy of the 
capital province of Chihli and the foremost 



266 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Chinese statesman; and Ting Yi Tcheang, then 
Governor of the Province of Kiang Su, Yet 
these men, convinced as they were by Wing's 
reasons and avowedly favorable to his project, 
with all their eminence of position and their 
influence, were not ready to venture the attempt 
to carry it through with the Imperial Govern- 
ment. All the forces of conservatism would be 
opposed to it; the time for it had not come, 

In 1867, however, the Governor Ting, who 
was the most willing of the three, had made 
representations to an Imperial Minister named 
Wan Cheang, on the strength of which he was 
advised to address a memorial on the subject to 
the Imperial Council at Peking, Van Cheang 
undertaking to commend it to the attention of 
the Council. The situation was at this juncture 
moderately hopeful, but before the memorial 
reached the Council, the mother of Wan Cheang 
died, by which event he was, under the law of 
Chinese high official etiquette, retired from pub- 
lic life three entire years, and the whole business 
was set back to where it had been. These were 
years of great trial to Yung Wing. He was 
prospering, indeed, in one point of view, but the 
hope to which he was devoted was so long de- 
ferred that his heart was often sick. Understand 



APPENDIX 267 

that he was leading there in China an essentially 
solitary life. He had, soon after Ms return in 
1855, in accordance with his views of what was 
due to his purpose, resumed his native dress and 
identified himself not only thus externally, but 
also in large measure in every other respect with 
his own people. Especially from the time he 
became a Chinese Government official, he had 
dwelt in Chinese society, and had disappeared 
almost wholly from other society. He had his 
books and kept up diligently with what was 
going on in the world of learning and letters 
outside it was his only resource but he was 
exceedingly alone and lonely notwithstanding. 
The discouragements to his endeavor that faced 
him were so numerous and so solid that he was 
sometimes half disposed to give it all up; but 
only half disposed. 

One of the things that held him to it was not 
of a nature of an encouragement exactly, but it 
did excellently well as an antidote to the effect 
upon his spirits of his discouragements. It be- 
gan to come to Ms ears now and than that his 
American and English friends in CMna were 
whispering it among themselves that he was a 
failure, that he had had a noble chance and had 
not known how to improve it; that he was im- 



268 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

practicable; and that this scheme of his was 
utterly visionary and could never be successful. 
Whenever Wing heard of this, he set his teeth 
and took a new hold. But altogether his faith 
and manhood were put to an extreme test. 

The end came though, as it always does in 
such cases, and came in a manner almost dra- 
matic. In the month of June, 1870, occurred 
the woeful tragedy at Tientsin called the Tien- 
tsin Massacre, in which a considerable number of 
French Roman Catholic missionaries, male and 
female, were murdered by a Chinese mob. It 
followed that a commission appointed by the 
foreign powers, diplomatically represented in 
China, met that same year at Tientsin to investi- 
gate the outrage and determine the satisfaction 
that was to be required for it, together with a 
like commission appointed by the Chinese Gov- 
ernment authorized to bring the affair to a settle- 
ment. The Chinese Commission consisted of 
five, and three of these five were the three men 
of whom mention has been made, the viceroys 
Tsang Koh Fan and Li Hung Chang, and the 
Governor Ting Yi Tcheang. 



APPENDIX 269 

AN OPPORTUNITY SEIZED 

Yung Wing was at this time under official 
control of the last named, who, on being sum- 
moned to Tientsin, sent him word, for he was 
at a distance from him, to join the Commission 
at Tientsin as soon as possible, for his services 
would be needed there. Wing, though hasten- 
ing, arrived late on the scene and found the 
business concluded. But on receiving an account 
of the difficulties that had attended its transac- 
tion, and observing that the commissioners were 
conscious of their disadvantage in it, he perceived 
an auspicious occasion for making a stroke in 
behalf of his scheme, and he made the most of it. 
He restated his arguments, enforcing them by 
the illustration of the case at hand, and insisted 
with the utmost earnestness that there ought to 
be no delay. And this time he prevailed. The 
three friends of his idea being together and coun- 
tenancing one another, then and there agreed 
that they would at once take action to have the 
thing he proposed done, and would cast their 
united influence with the Government in its 
favor. They kept their agreement. They set 
their names to a memorial recommending the 
education of a corps of young men abroad for 



270 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the Government service and at the Government 
expense. This memorial they forwarded to Pe- 
kin, where they backed it by all means in their 
power and to the effect that in the month of 
August, 1871, the measure recommended was 
adopted by the Imperial Government and a sum 
equal to $1,500,000 appropriated for its execu- 
tion. 

Mandarin Yung Wing was scarcely able to 
support the joy of his triumph. For two days, 
as he has told the writer, he could neither eat 
nor sleep. He walked on air, and he worshipped 
God. It was sixteen years after his return to 
China and twenty years after he set out for this 
goal that heaven had at last granted his prayer. 
To him the organization of the enterprise was 
principally committed. The feature of the long 
term of fifteen years resolved upon for the course 
of study and training to be pursued, is particu- 
larly due to him and reflects the size of the man, 
the type of his mind and character. 

A school of candidates was at once opened at 
Shanghai from which the pupils were to be se- 
lected by competitive examination, and, as has 
been already stated, the first detachment of thirty 
arrived in the United States in 1872. The lo- 
cation of the Mission was also for him to deter- 



APPENDIX 271 

mine. He might have procured its establishment 
in England, or France, or Germany; but as he 
himself had expressed it, the light that had en- 
lightened him shone from America and from 
New England, and to America and New Eng- 
land he was resolved from the first this Mission 
should repair. 

He was appointed Chief Commissioner of the 
Mission, receiving with the appointment his 
second promotion in rank, viz, to the Third or 
Blue Button grade. With him was associated, 
as co-commissioner, a venerable scholar and 
dignitary, Chin Lan Pin by name, who, how- 
ever, remained in this country less than two 
years, yielding his place to a younger man, Ngau 
Ngoh Liang, well-born, distinguished for learn- 
ing, and a most agreeable gentleman. 

The students of the Mission have thus far, with 
very few exceptions, exhibited excellent ability 
as scholars, and in many instances extraordinary 
ability, and with fewer exceptions still have been 
marked by their exemplary conduct. They have 
everywhere been most hospitably received. They 
are certainly worthy to be objects of the highest 
and most friendly interest to every Christian 
citizen of the United States. 

Yung Wing was appointed, December 11, 



#72 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

1876, Associate Minister with his former col- 
league in the Educational Mission, Chin Lan 
Pin, to the United States, Peru and Spain. On 
this occasion he was again promoted in rank, 
that is, to Second or Red Button grade, and 
invested with the title of Tao-tai (or Intend- 
ant) of the Province of Kiang Su. 

He expects, on the now approaching arrival 
of Chin Lan Pin in the country, to take up his 
residence in Washington, yet not to relinquish 
the general superintendence of the institution 
which is so dear to him and has cost him so much, 
and in which are hound up his best patriotic hopes 
for his native land, for he is a patriot from head 
to foot, in every fiber of his body. He loves the 
Chinese nation and believes in it, doubting not 
that there is before it a grand career worthy of 
its noble soil and of its august antiquity. 

If it were the aim of the writer to magnify 
Yung Wing, which it is not, but only to tell 
the story of the Chinese Educational Mission 
to the United States, there are many things 
more that might be related of him, all going to 
show Mm to be of the stuff that heroes are made 
of, and one of the most significant characters in 
modern civilization. But because to relate them 
would be aside from the purpose in hand, and 



APPENDIX 273 

also because it would grievously offend Yung 
Wing to have them published, they are passed 
by. It must be said, for the last word, that even 
in attributing to him so much credit of the Edu- 
cational Mission itself, the share he allows him- 
self is very far exceeded. He is accustomed to 
assign the chief honor of it to those three men 
of China who helped it so potently with their 
influence, Tsang Koh Fan died in 1871- His 
portrait hangs on the wall of the Mission House 
in Hartford; and the portraits of the other two 
are there also. The boys are taught to reverence 
these men as their benefactors. And they are 
worthy of reverence. Their names deserve to 
be remembered, and will be, and not alone in 
China. Yet undoubtedly had there been no 
Yung Wing, that illustrious good deed of theirs 
had never been performed,
