CHAPTER XIII 

MY INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG 
KWOH FAN 

In 1863, I was apparently prospering in my 
business, when, to my great surprise, an unex- 
pected letter from the city of Ngan Khing, capi- 
tal of An Whui province, was received. The 
writer was an old friend whose acquaintance I 
had made in Shanghai in 1857. He was a native 
of Ningpo, and was in charge of the first Chinese 
gunboat owned by the local Shanghai guild. He 
had apparently risen in official rank and had 
become one of Tsang Kwoh Fan's secretaries. 
His name was Chang Shi Kwei. In this 
letter, Chang said he was authorized by Viceroy 
Tsang Kwoh Fan to invite me to come down to 
Ngan Khing to call, as he (the Viceroy) had 
heard of me and wished very much to see me. 
On the receipt of the letter I was in a quandary 
and asked myself many questions: What could 
such a distinguished man want of me? Had he 
got wind of my late visit to Nanking and of my 
late enterprise to the district of Taiping for the 
green tea that was held there by the rebels? 

Tsang Kwoh Fan himself had been in the depart- 
ment of Hwui Chow fighting the rebels a year 
before and had been defeated, and he was 
reported to have been killed in battle. Could he 
have been told that I had been near the scene 
of his battle and had been in communication with 
the rebels, and did he want, under a polite invi- 
tation, to trap me and have my head off? But 
Chang, his secretary, was an old friend of many 
years' standing. I knew his character well; he 
wouldn't be likely to play the cat's paw to have 
me captured. Thus deliberating from one sur- 
mise to another, I concluded not to accept the 
invitation until I had learned more of the great 
man's purpose in sending for me. 

In reply to the letter, I wrote and said I 
thanked His Excellency for his great condescen- 
sion and considered it a great privilege and honor 
to be thus invited, but on account of the tea 
season having set in (which was in February) , 
I was obliged to attend to the orders for packing 
tea that were fast coming in; but that as soon as 
they were off my hands, I would manage to go 
and pay my respects to His Excellency. 

Two months after receiving the first letter, a 
second one came urging me to come to Ngan 
Khing as early as possible. This second letter 
enclosed a letter written by Li Sien Lan, the 
distinguished Chinese mathematician, whose 
acquaintance I had also made while in Shang- 
hai. He was the man who assisted a Mr. 
Wiley, a missionary of the London Board of 
Missions, in the translation of several mathemati- 
cal works into Chinese, among which was the 
Integral and Differential Calculus over which 
I well remember to have "flunked and fizzled' 
in my sophomore year in college; and, in this 
connection, I might as well frankly own that in 
my make-up mathematics was left out. Mr. Li 
Sien Lan was also an astronomer. In his letter, 
he said he had told Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan 
who I was and that I had had a foreign educa- 
tion; how I had raised a handsome subscription 
to help the famine refugees in 1857; that I had 
a strong desire to help China to become prosper- 
ous, powerful and strong. He said the viceroy 
had some important business for me to do, and 
that Chu and Wa, who were interested in 
machinery of all kinds, were also in Ngan Khing, 
having been invited there by the Viceroy. Mr- 
Li's letter completely dispelled all doubts and 
misgivings on my part as to the viceroy's design 
in wishing to see me, and gave me an insight as 
to his purpose for sending for me. 

As an answer to these letters, I wrote saying 
that in a couple of months I should be more at 
liberty to take the journey. But my second 
reply did not seem to satisfy the strong desire 
on the part of Tsang Kwoh Fan to see me. So 
in July, 1863, I received a third letter from 
Chang and a second one from Li. In these 
letters the object of the viceroy was clearly and 
frankly stated. He wanted me to give up my 
mercantile business altogether and identify my- 
self under him in the service of the state govern- 
ment, and asked whether or not I could come 
down to Ngan Khing at once. In view of this 
unexpected offer, which demanded prompt and 
explicit decision, I was not slow to see what pos- 
sibility there was of carrying out my educational 
scheme, having such a powerful man as Tsang 
Kwoh Fan to back it. I immediately replied 
that upon learning the wishes of His Excellency, 
I had taken the whole situation into considera- 
tion, and had concluded to go to his headquarters 
at Ngan Khing, just as soon as I had wound up 
my business, which would take me a complete 
month, and that I would start by August at the 
latest. Thus ended the correspondence which was 
really the initiatory step of my official career. 

Tsang Kwoh Fan was a most remarkable 
character in Chinese history. He was regarded 
by his contemporaries as a great scholar and a 
learned man. Soon after the Taiping Rebellion 
broke out and began to assume vast proportions, 
carrying before it province after province, 
Tsang began to drill an army of his own com- 
patriots of 'Hunan who had always had the repu- 
tation of being brave and hardy fighters. In his 
work of raising a disciplined army, he secured 
the co-operation of other Hunan men, who after- 
wards took a prominent part in building up a 
flotilla of river gunboats. This played a great 
and efficient part as an auxiliary force on the 
Yangtze River, and contributed in no small 
measure to check the rapid and ready concen- 
tration of the rebel forces, which had spread 
over a vast area on both banks of the great 
Yangtze River. In the space of a few years 
the lost provinces were gradually recovered, till 
the rebellion was narrowed down within the 
single province of Kiang Su, of which Nanking, 
the capital of the rebellion, was the only strong- 
hold left. This finally succumbed to the forces of 
Tsang Kwoh Fan in 1864. 

To crush and end a rebellion of such dimen- 
sions as that of the Taipings was no small task. 
Tsang Kwoh Fan was made the generalissimo 
of the imperialists. To enable him to cope suc- 
cessfully with the Taipings, Tsang was invested 
with almost regal power. The revenue of seven 
or eight provinces was laid at his feet for 
disposal, also official ranks and territorial 
appointments were at his command. So Tsang 
Kwoh Fan was literally and practically the 
supreme power of China at the time. But true 
to his innate greatness, he was never known to 
abuse the almost unlimited power that was 
placed in his hands, nor did he take advantage of 
the vast resources that were at his disposal to 
enrich himself or his family, relatives or friends. 
Unlike Li Hung Chang, his protege and suc- 
cessor, who bequeathed Tls. 40,000,000 to his 
descendants after his death, Tsang died compar- 
atively poor, and kept the escutcheon of his 
official career untarnished and left a name and 
character honored and revered for probity, pa- 
triotism and purity. He had great talents, but 
he was modest. He had a liberal mind, but he 
was conservative. He was a perfect gentleman 
and a nobleman of the highest type. It was such 
a man that I had the great fortune to come in 
contact with in the fall of 1863. 

After winding up my business in New Keang, 
I took passage in a native boat and landed at 
Ngan Khing in September. There, in the mili- 
tary headquarters of Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
I was met by my friends, Chang Si Kwei, Li 
Sien Lan, Wha Yuh Ting and Chu Siuh Chune, 
all old friends from Shanghai. They were glad 
to see me, and told me that the viceroy for the 
past six months, after hearing them tell that as 
a boy I had gone to America to get a Western 
education, had manifested the utmost curiosity 
and interest to see me, which accounted for the 
three letters which Chang and Li had written 
urging me to come. Now, since I had arrived, 
their efforts to get me there had not been fruitless, 
and they certainly claimed some credit for prais- 
ing me up to the viceroy. I asked them if they 
knew what His Excellency wanted me for, 
aside from the curiosity of seeing a native of 
China made into a veritable Occidental. They 
all smiled significantly and told me that I would 
find out after one or two interviews. From this, 
I judged that they knew the object for which 
I was wanted by the Viceroy, and perhaps, 
they were at the bottom of the whole 
secret. 

The next day I was to make my debut, and 
called. My card was sent in, and without a 
moment's delay or waiting in the ante-room, 
I was ushered into the presence of the great 
man of China. After the usual ceremonies 
of greeting, I was pointed to a seat right in front 
of him. For a few minutes he sat in silence, 
smiling all the while as though he were much 
pleased to see me, but at the same time his keen 
eyes scanned me over from head to foot to see if 
he could discover anything strange in my out- 
ward appearance. Finally, he took a steady look 
into my eyes which seemed to attract his special 
attention. I must confess I felt quite uneasy 
all the while, though I was not abashed. Then 
came his first question. 

"How long were you abroad ?" 

"I was absent from China eight years in pur- 
suit of a Western education." 

"Would you like to be a soldier in charge of a 
company?" 

"I should be pleased to head one if I had been 
fitted for it. I have never studied military 
science." 

"I should judge from your looks, you would 
make a fine soldier, for I can see from your eyes 
that you are brave and can command." 

"I thank Your Excellency for the compliment. 
I may have the courage of a soldier, but I cer- 
tainly lack military training and experience, and 
on that account I may not be able to meet Your 
Excellency's expectations."

When the question of being a soldier was sug- 
gested, I thought he really meant to have me 
enrolled as an officer in his army against the 
rebels ; but in this I was mistaken, as my Shang- 
hai friends told me afterwards. He simply put 
it forward to find out whether my mind was at 
all martially inclined. But when he found by my 
response that the bent of my thought was some- 
thing else, he dropped the military subject and 
asked me my age and whether or not I was mar- 
ried. The last question closed my first intro- 
ductory interview, which had lasted only about 
half an hour. He began to sip his tea and I did 
likewise, which according to Chinese official eti- 
quette means that the interview is ended and the 
guest is at liberty to take his departure.

我与曾国藩的会面

1863年，我的生意似乎蒸蒸日上，然而出人意料的是，我收到了来自安徽省省会安庆的一封信，令我颇为惊讶。来信人是一位旧友，我们是在1857年于上海相识的。他是宁波人，当时负责管理由上海地方行会所拥有的第一艘中国炮舰。显然他后来仕途顺利，已成为曾国藩的幕僚之一。他的名字叫张世夔。

在信中，张说他奉曾国藩之命，邀请我前往安庆拜会，称曾国藩早已听闻我的名声，非常希望与我一见。收到此信后，我陷入犹豫不决，心中充满疑问：如此显赫的人物为何要见我？他是否得知我最近曾前往南京，并涉足太平军所控制的产茶地区？曾国藩本人一年前还在徽州与太平军作战并遭到败绩，据说战死沙场。他是否被人告知我曾接近战场，并与太平军有所接触？他是否借着礼貌的邀请，实则意在设下陷阱将我斩首？

但张世夔是我多年的老朋友，我深知其人品，他断不会做出利用我作诱饵的事。在反复揣测中，我最终决定，在未弄清曾国藩邀我前往的真正用意之前，不贸然应约。

我回信称，感谢曾大人不吝屈尊相邀，视之为莫大荣耀。但因正值春茶季节（即二月），茶叶订单纷至沓来，我必须亲自督办包装发运；待手头事务告一段落，我定当前往拜见大人。

两个月后，我收到了第二封来信，催促我尽早前往安庆。此信中还附了一封由李善兰所写的信。李先生是中国著名数学家，我也曾在上海与他相识。他曾协助伦敦差会的传教士韦礼翻译了多部数学著作，其中包括《微积分学》，这正是我在大学二年级时曾“挂科”的那门课。借此机会我也得坦率承认，数学素养并非我所擅。李善兰先生也是一位天文学家。

在信中，他写道，已将我之背景告知曾国藩：我是留洋学生，1857年曾为赈济饥民筹款有功，并一心希望振兴中华。他说，曾大人有重要事务希望托我办理，且当时对机械等事务颇有兴趣的朱与华二人亦已受邀前往安庆。李先生的信彻底打消了我对曾大人意图的疑虑，并使我对他召我前去的真实用意有了初步了解。

我回信称，大约两个月后，我将可脱身前往。但这第二封信显然未能满足曾国藩急欲与我会面的强烈愿望。于是，1863年7月，我收到了张的第三封信与李的第二封信。在这两封信中，曾国藩的用意被明白无误地表露出来——他希望我彻底放弃商贸事务，转而在他麾下供职于地方政府，并问我是否可即刻动身前往安庆。

面对这一突如其来的提议，我立刻意识到，有了像曾国藩这样一位强有力的支持者，我实现教育理想的机会大为增加。于是我立即回信表示，已认真权衡当前形势，决定结束手头生意后便动身前往安庆，此事需时一个整月，最迟将于八月启程。此番通信，便成为我踏入仕途的初步契机。

曾国藩是中国历史上极为杰出的人物。他在当时被公认为大学者、鸿儒。太平天国起事后，战火席卷诸省，曾国藩开始在湖南家乡组织义军，湖南人素有勇武之名。他在筹建纪律严明军队的过程中，得到了许多湖南乡贤的协助，这些人后来又协力建造了一支由江上炮舰组成的舰队，对抗太平军在长江两岸的迅速集结起到了极大遏制作用。几年之内，失地陆续收复，战线被压缩至江苏一省，南京作为太平军的最后堡垒，终于于1864年陷落于曾国藩军下。

要镇压一场如太平天国般波澜壮阔的叛乱，绝非易事。曾国藩被朝廷任命为帝国军队最高统帅，并赋予几近王侯之权：七八省赋税尽归其调配，官职任命亦由其掌握。换言之，彼时的曾国藩几乎执掌中国之最高实权。然而，秉性高洁的他，从未滥用手中几近无边的权力，也未借此为己或家族亲朋谋利。与其门生兼接班人李鸿章不同——后者死后留给后代四千万两白银——曾国藩却几近两袖清风，名节清白，终其一生以清廉、忠诚与正直著称。他才华横溢却谦逊为人，思想开明却不失保守气质，是中国士人中最理想的绅士与贵族的典范。能在1863年秋与如此人物相识，可谓我人生莫大之幸。

我将新江的生意处理完毕后，于九月搭乘本地船只前往安庆。在曾国藩的军政官署，我得以与几位旧友重逢：张世夔、李善兰、华煜廷、朱秀春，皆为我在上海时期的好友。他们见到我非常高兴，并告诉我，曾大人在过去半年中，听说我自幼赴美求学后，始终心怀强烈好奇与兴趣，因此屡次命他们写信催我前来。如今我终于抵达，他们对促成此事自觉颇有功劳，并不吝自夸一番。我问他们：除了对我这种“中人变洋人”的好奇外，大人是否另有所求？他们皆报以意味深长的一笑，说：“面见一两次，你自会明了。”由此我推断，他们心中已有答案，且或许正是这番安排的幕后推手。

第二日，我首次入府拜谒。拜帖递入后，我未在前厅等候片刻，便被引见至这位中国显贵面前。礼节完毕，我被请至正对他的位置落座。他沉默数分钟，始终微笑，似对我的到来感到十分欣喜，同时一双锐利目光从头到脚打量我，仿佛试图从外表中发现异样之处。最后，他凝视着我的双眼，似格外感兴趣。我虽略觉不安，但并不惶恐。他开口问我：

“你在国外多久？”

“我为求西学，离华八年。”

“你可愿做带兵之将？”

“若有此才能，自当愿从其事。但我未曾学过兵法。”

“看你面貌，我以为你可为良将；你眼神中有英气，可号令众人。”

“承蒙大人抬爱。若说胆略，我或许不差；但无兵学训练，怕难副大人厚望。”

他初提兵事，我一度误以为他欲召我入军讨贼；而据后来上海友人所言，实则不然，他此问仅为探我是否具军事志趣。但见我答复之意不在武职，便不再多谈，转而问我年龄与婚否。此后他轻啜香茗，我亦随之而饮。按中国官场礼节，此即表明谈话已毕，宾客可告辞离席。

谒见曾国藩

1863年，当我正沉浸于商务顺遂之际，一封来自安徽省城安庆的意外信函令我惊诧不已。写信者乃1857年我在上海结识的旧友张斯桂，这位宁波人曾执掌上海商团首艘中国炮舰，如今已擢升为曾国藩幕僚。信中言明受曾督之托邀我赴安庆谒见，因大人久闻我名亟欲一见。

接信后我陷入踌躇：这位显赫人物寻我何为？莫非察觉我曾暗访天京，或知悉我深入太平军辖区贩运绿茶之事？去岁曾国藩亲征徽州兵败，传闻已战死沙场。若他得知我曾在战场附近与叛军往来，此番礼邀恐是请君入瓮之计？然张斯桂乃多年故交，其品性我深悉，断不会诱我入彀。几经权衡，我决定暂不应邀，先探明其真实意图。

回信中我以茶季繁忙为由婉谢，承诺待春茶装箱事毕即往谒见。两月后第二封催请函至，随附著名数学家李善兰手书——此君曾协助伦敦会传教士伟烈亚力翻译《微积分》等著作（这门学问我在大二时曾狼狈败北，坦率说我的天赋树本无数学枝桠）。李公信中详述：他已向曾督禀明我之西洋教育背景、咸丰七年赈灾义举及报国宏愿，并透露总督有要事相托，机械专家华蘅芳、徐寿此刻亦在安庆幕府。此信顿消我疑窦，使我对总督召见目的了然于胸。

二次回信仍请宽限两月，然曾公求贤若渴。1863年7月第三封敦促函至，终明言欲我弃商入幕。面对这足以推动教育计划的绝佳机遇，我承诺最迟八月交割完商务即赴安庆。这番鱼雁往来，就此开启了我的宦海生涯。

曾国藩实为中国史上奇杰。时人尊其为硕学鸿儒，当太平天国势如破竹之际，他独以湘勇为基编练新军（湘人素以骁勇著称），更创长江水师扼制叛军调度。数年间收复失地，终在1864年克复天京，平定这场席卷半壁江山的巨患。

作为剿匪统帅，曾国藩掌七省财赋、握百官黜陟，权倾天下却清介自守。较之身后留下四千万两遗产的门生李鸿章，曾公去世时家无余财，其廉洁爱国之名为世所钦。他才高而行谨，思想开明却持身守正，堪称士林典范。1863年秋，我竟有幸与这位伟人相逢。

九月抵安庆督署，张斯桂、李善兰、华蘅芳、徐寿等沪上故交迎我于辕门。他们透露半年来曾督对我这个"西洋化华人"充满好奇，故有三催之举。问及召见真意，众人笑而不答，只言晤面自明。

翌日晋见，通名后即刻引入。寒暄毕，曾公默坐端详我良久，目光如炬似要洞穿这副异域淬炼的形骸，尤对我的双目凝视不移。首问留洋几何？答以八载。次问可愿统兵？我坦言："虽具胆略，未习韬略。"后来才知此乃试探我心志所在。及见我无意军旅，便转询年齿婚否。半盏茶尽，初谒告终——按官场仪制，端茶即是送客。







I returned to my room, and my Shanghai 
friends soon flocked around me to know what 
had passed between the viceroy and myself. I 
told them everything, and they were highly de- 
lighted. 

Tsang Kwoh Fan, as he appeared in 1863, 
was over sixty years of age, in the very prime of 
life. He was five feet, eight or nine inches tall, 
strongly built and well-knitted together and in 
fine proportion. He had a broad chest and 
square shoulders surmounted by a large sym- 
metrical head. He had a broad and high fore- 
head; his eyes were set on a straight line under 
triangular-shaped eyelids, free from that obliq- 
uity so characteristic of the Mongolian type of 
countenance usually accompanied by high cheek 
bones, which is another feature peculiar to the 
Chinese physiognomy. His face was straight 
and somewhat hairy. He allowed his side whisk- 
ers their full growth; they hung down with his 
full beard which swept across a broad chest and 
added dignity to a commanding appearance. 
His eyes though not large were keen and pene- 
trating. They were of a clear hazel color. His 
mouth was large but well compressed with thin 
lips which showed a strong will and a high pur- 
pose. Such was Tsang Kwoh Fan's external 
appearance, when I first met him at Ngan 
Khing. 

Regarding his character, he was undoubted- 
ly one of the most remarkable men of his age and 
time. As a military general, he might be called 
a self-made man; by dint of his indomitable per- 
sistence and perseverance, he rose from his high 
scholarship as a Hanlin (Chinese LL.D.) to be 
a generalissimo of all the imperial forces that 
were levied against the Taiping rebels, and in less 
than a decade after he headed his Hunan raw 
recruits, he succeeded in reducing the wide dev- 
astations of the rebellion that covered a terri- 
torial area of three of the richest provinces of 
China to the single one of Kiang Nan, till finally, 
by the constriction of his forces, he succeeded in 
crushing the life out of the rebellion by the fall 
and capture of Nanking, The Taiping Rebel- 
lion was of fifteen years' duration, from 1850 to 
1865. It was no small task to bring it to its ex- 
tinction. Its rise and progress had cost the Em- 
pire untold treasures, while 25,000,000 human 
lives were immolated in that political hecatomb. 
The close of the great rebellion gave the people 
a breathing respite. The Dowager Empress had 
special reasons to be grateful to the genius of 
Tsang Kwoh Fan, who was instrumental in re- 
storing peace and order to the Manchu Dynasty. 
She was not slow, however, to recognize Tsang 
Kwoh Fan's merits and moral worth and created 
him a duke. But Tsang' s greatness was not to be 
measured by any degree of conventional nobility; 
it did not consist in his victories over the rebels, 
much less in his re-capture of Nanking* It rose 
from his great virtues: his pure, unselfish patriot- 
ism, his deep and far-sighted statesmanship, and 
the purity of his official career. He is known in 
history as "the man of rectitude." This was his 
posthumous title conferred on him by imperial 
decree.

To resume the thread of my story, I was near- 
ly two weeks in the viceroy's headquarters, oc- 
cupying a suite of rooms in the same building 
assigned to my Shanghai friends Li, Chang, 
Wha and Chu. There were living in his military 
headquarters at least two hundred officials, gath- 
ered there from all parts of the Empire, for va- 
rious objects and purposes. Besides his secre- 
taries, who numbered no less than a hundred, 
there were expectant officials, learned scholars, 
lawyers, mathematicians, astronomers and ma- 
chinists; in short, the picked and noted men of 
China were all drawn there by the magnetic 
force of his character and great name. He al- 
ways had a great admiration for men of distin- 
guished learning and talents, and loved to asso- 
ciate and mingle with them. During the two 
weeks of my sojourn there, I had ample oppor- 
tunity to call upon my Shanghai friends, and in 
that way incidentally found out what the object 
of the Viceroy was in urging me to be enrolled 
in the government service. It seemed that my 
friends had had frequent interviews with the 
Viceroy in regard to having a foreign machine 
shop established in China, but it had not been de- 
termined what kind of a machine shop should be 
established* One evening they gave me a dinner, 
at which time the subject of the machine shop 
was brought up and it became the chief topic. 
After each man had expressed his views on the 
subject excepting myself, they wanted to know 
what my views were, intimating that in all like- 
lihood in my next interview with the Viceroy he 
would bring up the subject. I said that as I was 
not an expert in the matter, my opinions or sug- 
gestions might not be worth much, but neverthe- 
less from my personal observation in the United 
States and from a common-sense point of view, 
I would say that a machine shop in the present 
state of China should be of a general and funda- 
mental character and not one for specific pur- 
poses. In other words, I told them they ought 
to have a machine shop that would be able to 
create or reproduce other machine shops of the 
same character as itself; each and all of these 
should be able to turn out specific machinery 
for the manufacture of specific things. In plain 
words, they would have to have general and 
fundamental machinery in order to turn out 
specific machinery. A machine shop consisting 
of lathes of different kinds and sizes, planers and 
drills would be able to turn out machinery for 
making guns, engines, agricultural implements, 
clocks, etc. In a large country like China, I told 
them, they would need many primary or funda- 
mental machine shops, but that after they had 
one (and a first-class one at that) they could 
make it the mother shop for reproducing others 
perhaps better and more improved. If they 
had a number of them, it would enable them to 
have the shops co-operate with each other in case 
of need. It would be cheaper to have them re- 
produced and multiplied in China, I said, where 
labor and material were cheaper, than in Europe 
and America. Such was my crude idea of the 
subject. After I had finished, they were appar- 
ently much pleased and interested, and expressed 
the hope that I would state the same views to the 
Viceroy if he should ask me about the subject. 
Several days after the dinner and conversation, 
the Viceroy did send for me. In this interview 
he asked me what in my opinion was the best 
thing to do for China at that time. The question 
came with such a force of meaning, that if I had 
not been f orwarned by my friends a few evenings 
before, or if their hearts had not been set on the 
introduction of a machine shop, and they had not 
practically won the Viceroy over to their pet 
scheme, I might have been strongly tempted to 
launch forth upon my educational scheme as a 
reply to the question as to what was the best thing 
to do for China. But in such an event, being a 
stranger to the Viceroy, having been brought to 
his notice simply through the influence of my 
friends, I would have run a greater risk of 
jeopardizing my pet scheme of education than if I 
were left to act independently. My obligations 
to them were great, and I therefore decided that 
my constancy and fidelity to their friendship 
should be correspondingly great. So, instead of 
finding myself embarrassed in answering such a 
large and important question, I had a precon- 
ceived answer to give, which seemed to dove-tail 
into his views already crystallized into definite 
form, and which was ready to be carried out at 
once. So my educational scheme was put in the 
background, and the machine shop was allowed 
to take precedence. I repeated in substance 
what I had said to my friends previously in regard 
to establishing a mother machine shop, capable of 
reproducing other machine shops of like 
character, etc. I especially mentioned the 
manufacture of rifles, which, I said, required for the 
manufacture of their component parts separate 
machinery, but that the machine shop I would 
recommend was not one adapted for making the 
rifles, but adapted to turn out specific machinery 
for the making of rifles, cannons, cartridges, or 
anything else. 

"Well," said he, "this is a subject quite beyond 
my knowledge. It would be well for you to dis- 
cuss the matter with Wha and Chu, who are 
more familiar with it than I am and we will 
then decide what is best to be done." 

This ended my interview with the Viceroy. 
After I left him, I met my friends, who were 
anxious to know the result of the interview. I 
told them of the outcome. They were highly 
elated over it. In our last conference it was 
decided that the matter of the character of the 
machine shop was to be left entirely to my dis- 
cretion and judgment, after consulting a profes- 
sional mechanical engineer. At the end of another 
two weeks, Wha was authorized to tell me that 
the Viceroy, after having seen all the four men, 
had decided to empower me to go abroad and 
make purchases of such machinery as in the opin- 
ion of a professional engineer would be the best 
and the right machinery for China to adopt. It 
was also left entirely to me to decide where the 
machinery should be purchased, either in England, 
France or the United States of America. 
The location of the machine shop was to be at 
a place called Kow Chang Meu, about four miles 
northwest of the city of Shanghai. The Kow 
Chang Meu machine shop was afterwards known 
as the Kiang Nan Arsenal, an establishment that 
covers several acres of ground and embraces 
under its roof all the leading branches of me- 
chanical work. Millions have been invested in it 
since I brought the first machinery from Fitch- 
burg, Mass., in order to make it one of the great- 
est arsenals east of the Cape of Good Hope. It 
may properly be regarded as a lasting monument 
to commemorate Tsang Kwoh Fan's broad-mindedness 
as well as far-sightedness in establishing 
Western machinery in China. 

我回到房间后，上海的朋友们立刻围了过来，想知道我与总督之间谈了些什么。我把事情的经过原原本本地告诉了他们，他们听后都非常高兴。

曾国藩在1863年时，已年逾六旬，正值人生盛年。他身高约五尺八九英寸，体格健壮，结构匀称，比例匀衡。他胸膛宽阔，双肩方正，头部硕大且对称。他的额头又宽又高，眼睛在一条直线上，眼睑呈三角形，毫无蒙古人种面孔常见的那种斜长特征，也没有中国人常见的高颧骨。他的脸庞端正而略带胡须。他让鬓须自然生长，与浓密的胡须一起垂下，覆盖在他宽广的胸膛上，平添几分威严。他的眼睛虽然不大，但炯炯有神，目光锐利，呈清澈的榛子色。他的嘴很大，但紧闭而不松懈，嘴唇单薄，显露出坚定的意志和远大的抱负。初次在安庆见到曾国藩时，他的外貌就是如此。

至于他的性格，他无疑是那个时代最杰出的人物之一。作为军事将领，他可谓自我奋斗的典范。凭着坚忍不拔的毅力和恒心，他从翰林出身（相当于中国的法学博士）逐步晋升为统领全军、对抗太平军的总指挥。在他率领湘军起事不到十年时间里，便将席卷中国三大富庶省份的大规模叛乱，压缩至江南一地。最终，他通过集中兵力，攻陷并夺取南京，将太平天国的生命彻底终结。太平天国之乱历时十五年（1850–1865），其平定之艰巨可想而知。起义的兴起与蔓延使整个帝国耗费无数金银财宝，牺牲了约二千五百万人生命，可谓一场政治浩劫的血祭。叛乱的终结终于给百姓带来了喘息之机。慈禧太后对曾国藩功勋卓著、协助恢复满清统治秩序心怀感激，对他的道德品格也甚为赏识，封其为一等公。但曾国藩的伟大，并非体现在对太平军的胜利，或是夺回南京之功，更不在其爵位，而在于他卓绝的品德：纯洁无私的爱国之心，高瞻远瞩的政治眼光，以及清廉正直的仕途生涯。他在史书中被称为“忠正之人”，这是朝廷追赠他的谥号。

回到我故事的正题，我在总督府住了将近两周，和李、张、华、朱几位上海朋友同处一幢楼中。总督的军事幕府中大约住有两百位官员，这些人从全国各地聚集而来，各有不同的职责与目的。除了百名书记官外，还有候补官员、博学之士、律师、数学家、天文学家、机械技师等，总之，各地精英齐聚于此，皆为曾国藩的名望与人格魅力所吸引。他尤其敬重有学识、有才干之人，乐于与他们交往讨论。在这两周的时间里，我有很多机会与上海的朋友交流，也渐渐了解到总督希望我入仕的真正目的。

原来，我的朋友们多次与总督商谈在中国创设一个外国机械工厂，但一直未决定该工厂应采取何种形式。某天晚上，他们设宴款待我，席间话题转到机械工厂上来，成为当天的核心议题。除了我之外，每人都发表了自己的意见，他们随后也希望我能谈谈自己的看法，还暗示说，下次与总督会面时，总督很可能会问我这个问题。我答道，虽然我在这方面不是专家，意见未必有什么价值，但凭我在美国的观察和常识判断，我认为现阶段的中国应建立一种综合性的、基础性的机械工厂，而不是单一用途的。换句话说，我建议建设一个“母工厂”，能够制造或复制出其他同类型的工厂；而这些子工厂应具备生产各种专用机器的能力。直白地说，要先有通用基础机械，才能制造专门用途的机械设备。一个配备各类车床、刨床和钻床的机械工厂，能够生产枪械、引擎、农业工具、钟表等机械。在中国这样一个幅员辽阔的国家，需要建立多个这样的基础性机械厂。一旦建成第一个高质量的“母工厂”，便可以复制或改进成更多类似工厂。而且，相比于在欧美制造，利用中国本地较低的人力与物资成本，在国内复制工厂更加划算。这就是我对该问题的一点粗浅认识。我讲完之后，大家都表现出很大兴趣和满意之情，并希望我在与总督会面时也表达同样的看法。

几天后，总督果然召见了我。在这次会面中，他问我：“在你看来，现在对中国来说最该做的事情是什么？”这个问题意味深长，若非几天前朋友们的提醒，或者如果他们没有将心思投注在建设机械工厂、也未能说服总督认可他们的方案，我或许会情不自禁地讲出自己关于教育改革的主张。然而，这样做可能会因我与总督并不熟识，只是靠朋友们的引荐才得以见面的身份，而使得我自身推行教育理想的计划面临更大风险。既然我欠他们人情，那我在忠诚与信任方面也应同样坚定。因此，我没有被这宏大的问题难倒，反而早有准备，给出了一个与总督既有构想不谋而合的答案，可立即付诸实行。于是，我的教育计划暂时搁置，让位于机械工厂的设想。我把自己曾对朋友说过的“母工厂”概念再复述了一遍，并强调这种工厂不是用来直接制造枪械，而是制造那些制造枪械、炮弹、子弹等的专用机械。

他听完后说：“唔，这方面我并不熟悉。你还是与华、朱两位多加讨论，他们对此比我了解更多。等你们商讨妥当，我们再决定怎么做。”

这次会面至此结束。我离开总督后，朋友们立刻来询问谈话结果。我把经过告诉了他们，他们听后欣喜若狂。在我们最后一次会议中，一致决定关于工厂性质的事情，完全由我与专业机械工程师商议后自行判断决定。又过了两周，华奉命告知我，总督在与四人分别会面后，决定授权我前往国外采购机械，由我与专业工程师判断、选择最适合中国的机械设备。此外，机械的采购地点完全由我决定，无论是英、法还是美皆可。工厂选址在上海城西北约四英里处，名为高昌庙。后来，高昌庙机械厂被命名为“江南制造总局”，占地数英亩，涵盖几乎所有重要的机械加工工艺。自我从美国马萨诸塞州费奇堡带回第一批机器后，政府已在该局投资数百万资金，力图将其建设为好望角以东最重要的兵工厂之一。可以说，这座工厂堪称一座纪念碑，象征曾国藩在引进西方机械技术方面的远见卓识与开明气度。

回到寓所，沪上故旧纷纷前来探问谒见情形。听罢我的叙述，众人皆喜形于色。

1863年的曾国藩虽年逾六旬，却仍如劲松般挺拔。他身高五尺八九（约1.75米），体格魁伟匀称，宽肩阔胸上托着颗硕大端庄的头颅。天庭饱满的额下生着双三角眼睑的平直眼睛——全无蒙古人种常见的吊梢眼特征，亦无汉人典型的高颧骨。面部线条刚毅须髯丰茂，腮边垂下的络腮胡与胸前飘拂的长髯，更添不怒自威之态。那双淡褐色眸子虽不甚大却锐利如鹰，阔而薄抿的嘴唇昭示着钢铁意志。这便是安庆初见时，这位被史册尊为"文正公"的一代儒将风仪。

论其勋业，这位翰林出身的湘军统帅，以十年之功将太平天国之乱从三省糜烂压缩至江南一隅，终在1864年克复金陵。这场持续十五载、耗竭国库、夺命二千五百万的浩劫得以平息，使垂帘听政的慈禧太后对曾公铭感五内，赐封侯爵。然其伟大非因战功彪炳，而在于清正廉明的操守、高瞻远瞩的政略，以及"以天下为己任"的赤忱。

我在督署盘桓近半月，与李善兰、张斯桂、华蘅芳、徐寿同住一院。这座容纳二百余名幕僚的军事中枢，实为当时中国精英荟萃之地：待补官员、经学大师、刑名讼师、历算家、机械师济济一堂，皆被曾公的人格磁场所吸引。期间我从故交处探得，总督急欲召我实为筹建机器局之事。某夜宴饮时，众人专就此议征询我见——因料想曾公必将垂询。我坦言："中国当务之急应设基础性母厂，使其能衍生子厂。譬若拥有各类车床、刨床、钻床的综合机械厂，既可制造枪炮引擎，亦能生产农具钟表。"此论令在座耳目一新，嘱我若蒙垂问当畅抒己见。

数日后二次谒见，曾公果然问及"救国良策"。若非故交们早已铺垫，我本欲力陈教育计划，然为不负知遇之恩，终将酝酿多年的西学蓝图按下不表，转而详述母厂理念："所需非专造枪械之厂，乃能制枪械机床之厂。"曾公从善如流，着我会同华、徐二位专家详议。

两星期后华蘅芳传来钧命：授权我全权赴欧美采购设备，选址定于上海高昌庙。这座日后占地数百亩的江南制造总局，自我从马萨诸塞州费奇堡运回首批机械起，便成为好望角以东最宏大的军械制造基地。它不仅是近代中国工业化的里程碑，更是曾国藩开明远见的不朽丰碑。
