CHAPTER XIII 

MY INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG 
KWOH FAN 

In 1863, I was apparently prospering in my 
business, when, to my great surprise, an unex- 
pected letter from the city of Ngan Khing, capi- 
tal of An Whui province, was received. The 
writer was an old friend whose acquaintance I 
had made in Shanghai in 1857. He was a native 
of Ningpo, and was in charge of the first Chinese 
gunboat owned by the local Shanghai guild. He 
had apparently risen in official rank and had 
become one of Tsang Kwoh Fan's secretaries. 
His name was Chang Shi Kwei. In this 
letter, Chang said he was authorized by Viceroy 
Tsang Kwoh Fan to invite me to come down to 
Ngan Khing to call, as he (the Viceroy) had 
heard of me and wished very much to see me. 
On the receipt of the letter I was in a quandary 
and asked myself many questions: What could 
such a distinguished man want of me? Had he 
got wind of my late visit to Nanking and of my 
late enterprise to the district of Taiping for the 

green tea that was held there by the rebels?

Tsang Kwoh Fan himself had been in the depart- 
ment of Hwui Chow fighting the rebels a year 
before and had been defeated, and he was 
reported to have been killed in battle. Could he 
have been told that I had been near the scene 
of his battle and had been in communication with 
the rebels, and did he want, under a polite invi- 
tation, to trap me and have my head off? But 
Chang, his secretary, was an old friend of many 
years' standing. I knew his character well; he 
wouldn't be likely to play the cat's paw to have 
me captured. Thus deliberating from one sur- 
mise to another, I concluded not to accept the 
invitation until I had learned more of the great 
man's purpose in sending for me. 

In reply to the letter, I wrote and said I 
thanked His Excellency for his great condescen- 
sion and considered it a great privilege and honor 
to be thus invited, but on account of the tea 
season having set in (which was in February) , 
I was obliged to attend to the orders for packing 
tea that were fast coming in; but that as soon as 
they were off my hands, I would manage to go 
and pay my respects to His Excellency. 

Two months after receiving the first letter, a 
second one came urging me to come to Ngan 
Khing as early as possible. This second letter 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 139 

enclosed a letter written by Li Sien Lan, the 
distinguished Chinese mathematician, whose 
acquaintance I had also made while in Shang- 
hai. He was the man who assisted a Mr. 
Wiley, a missionary of the London Board of 
Missions, in the translation of several mathemati- 
cal works into Chinese, among which was the 
Integral and Differential Calculus over which 
I well remember to have "flunked and fizzled' 9 
in my sophomore year in college; and, in this 
connection, I might as well frankly own that in 
my make-up mathematics was left out. Mr. Li 
Sien Lan was also an astronomer. In his letter, 
he said he had told Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan 
who I was and that I had had a foreign educa- 
tion; how I had raised a handsome subscription 
to help the famine refugees in 1857; that I had 
a strong desire to help China to become prosper- 
ous, powerful and strong. He said the viceroy 
had some important business for me to do, and 
that Chu and Wa, who were interested in 
machinery of all kinds, were also in Ngan Khing, 
having been invited there by the Viceroy. Mr- 
Li's letter completely dispelled all doubts and 
misgivings on my part as to the viceroy's design 
in wishing to see me, and gave me an insight as 
to his purpose for sending for me. 



140 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

As an answer to these letters, I wrote saying 
that in a couple of months I should be more at 
liberty to take the journey. But my second 
reply did not seem to satisfy the strong desire 
on the part of Tsang Kwoh Fan to see me. So 
in July, 1868, I received a third letter from 
Chang and a second one from Li. In these 
letters the object of the viceroy was clearly and 
frankly stated. He wanted me to give up my 
mercantile business altogether and identify my- 
self under him in the service of the state govern- 
ment, and asked whether or not I could come 
down to Ngan Khing at once. In view of this 
unexpected offer, which demanded prompt and 
explicit decision, I was not slow to see what pos- 
sibility there was of carrying out my educational 
scheme, having such a powerful man as Tsang 
Kwoh Fan to back it. I immediately replied 
that upon learning the wishes of His Excellency, 
I had taken the whole situation into considera- 
tion, and had concluded to go to his headquarters 
at Ngan Khing, just as soon as I had wound up 
my business, which would take me a complete 
month, and that I would start by August at the 
latest. Thus ended the correspondence which was 
really the initiatory step of my official career. 

Tsang Kwoh Fan was a most remarkable 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 141 

character in Chinese history. He was regarded 
by his contemporaries as a great scholar and a 
learned man. Soon after the Taiping Rebellion 
broke out and began to assume vast proportions, 
carrying before it province after province, 
Tsang began to drill an army of his own com- 
patriots of 'Hunan who had always had the repu- 
tation of being brave and hardy fighters. In his 
work of raising a disciplined army, he secured 
the co-operation of other Hunan men, who after- 
wards took a prominent part in building up a 
flotilla of river gunboats. This played a great 
and efficient part as an auxiliary force on the 
Yangtze River, and contributed in no small 
measure to check the rapid and ready concen- 
tration of the rebel forces, which had spread 
over a vast area on both banks of the great 
Yangtze River. In the space of a few years 
the lost provinces were gradually recovered, till 
the rebellion was narrowed down within the 
single province of Kiang Su, of which Nanking, 
the capital of the rebellion, was the only strong- 
hold left. This finally succumbed to the forces of 
Tsang Kwoh Fan in 1864. 

To crush and end a rebellion of such dimen- 
sions as that of the Taipings was no small task. 
Tsang Kwoh Fan was made the generalissimo 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

of the imperialists. To enable him to cope suc- 
cessfully with the Taipings, Tsang was invested 
with almost regal power. The revenue of seven 
or eight provinces was laid at his feet for 
disposal, also official ranks and territorial 
appointments were at his command. So Tsang 
Kwoh Fan was literally and practically the 
supreme power of China at the time. But true 
to his innate greatness, he was never known to 
abuse the almost unlimited power that was 
placed in his hands, nor did he take advantage of 
the vast resources that were at his disposal to 
enrich himself or his family, relatives or friends. 
Unlike Li Hung Chang, his protege and suc- 
cessor, who bequeathed Tls. 40,000,000 to his 
descendants after his death, Tsang died compar- 
atively poor, and kept the escutcheon of his 
official career untarnished and left a name and 
character honored and revered for probity, pa- 
triotism and purity. He had great talents, but 
he was modest. He had a liberal mind, but he 
was conservative. He was a perfect gentleman 
and a nobleman of the highest type. It was such 
a man that I had the great fortune to come in 
contact with in the fall of 1863. 

After winding up my business in New Keang, 
I took passage in a native boat and landed at 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 143 

Ngan Khing in September. There, in the mili- 
tary headquarters of Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
I was met by my friends, Chang Si Kwei, Li 
Sien Lan, Wha Yuh Ting and Chu Siuh Chune, 
all old friends from Shanghai. They were glad 
to see me, and told me that the viceroy for the 
past six months, after hearing them tell that as 
a boy I had gone to America to get a Western 
education, had manifested the utmost curiosity 
and interest to see me, which accounted for the 
three letters which Chang and Li had written 
urging me to come. Now, since I had arrived, 
their efforts to get me there had not been fruitless, 
and they certainly claimed some credit for prais- 
ing me up to the viceroy. I asked them if they 
knew what His Excellency wanted me for, 
aside from the curiosity of seeing a native of 
China made into a veritable Occidental. They 
all smiled significantly and told me that I would 
find out after one or two interviews. From this, 
I judged that they knew the object for which 
I was wanted by the Viceroy, and perhaps, 
they were at the bottom of the whole 
secret. 

The next day I was to make my debut, and 
called. My card was sent in, and without a 
moment's delay or waiting in the ante-room, 



144 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

I was ushered into the presence of the great 
man of China. After the usual ceremonies 
of greeting, I was pointed to a seat right in front 
of him. For a few minutes he sat in silence, 
smiling all the while as though he were much 
pleased to see me, but at the same time his keen 
eyes scanned me over from head to foot to see if 
he could discover anything strange in my out- 
ward appearance. Finally, he took a steady look 
into my eyes which seemed to attract his special 
attention. I must confess I felt quite uneasy 
all the while, though I was not abashed. Then 
came his first question. 

"How long were you abroad ?" 

"I was absent from China eight years in pur- 
suit of a Western education." 

"Would you like to be a soldier in charge of a 
company?" 

"I should be pleased to head one if I had been 
fitted for it. I have never studied military 



science." 



"I should judge from your looks, you would 
make a fine soldier, for I can see from your eyes 
that you are brave and can command." 

"I thank Your Excellency for the compliment. 
I may have the courage of a soldier, but I cer- 
tainly lack military training and experience, and 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 145 

on that account I may not be able to meet Your 
Excellency's expectations/* 

When the question of being a soldier was sug- 
gested, I thought he really meant to have me 
enrolled as an officer in his army against the 
rebels ; but in this I was mistaken, as my Shang- 
hai friends told me afterwards. He simply put 
it forward to find out whether my mind was at 
all martially inclined. But when he found by my 
response that the bent of my thought was some- 
thing else, he dropped the military subject and 
asked me my age and whether or not I was mar- 
ried. The last question closed my first intro- 
ductory interview, which had lasted only about 
half an hour. He began to sip his tea and I did 
likewise, which according to Chinese official eti- 
quette means that the interview is ended and the 
guest is at liberty to take his departure., 

I returned to my room, and my Shanghai 
friends soon flocked around me to know what 
had passed between the viceroy and myself. I 
told them everything, and they were highly de- 
lighted. 

Tsang Kwoh Fan, as he appeared in 1863, 
was over sixty years of age, in the very prime of 
life. He was five feet, eight or nine inches tall, 
strongly built and well-knitted together and in 



146 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

fine proportion. He had a broad chest and 
square shoulders surmounted by a large sym- 
metrical head. He had a broad and high fore- 
head; his eyes were set on a straight line under 
triangular-shaped eyelids, free from that obliq- 
uity so characteristic of the Mongolian type of 
countenance usually accompanied by high cheek 
bones, which is another feature peculiar to the 
Chinese physiognomy. His face was straight 
and somewhat hairy. He allowed his side whisk- 
ers their full growth; they hung down with his 
full beard which swept across a broad chest and 
added dignity to a commanding appearance. 
His eyes though not large were keen and pene- 
trating. They were of a clear hazel color. His 
mouth was large but well compressed with thin 
lips which showed a strong will and a high pur- 
pose. Such was Tsang Kwoh Fan's external 
appearance, when I first met him at Ngan 
Khing. 

Regarding his character, he was undoubted- 
ly one of the most remarkable men of his age and 
time. As a military general, he might be called 
a self-made man; by dint of his indomitable per- 
sistence and perseverance, he rose from his high 
scholarship as a Hanlin (Chinese LL.D.) to be 
a generalissimo of all the imperial forces that 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 147 

were levied against the Taiping rebels, and in less 
than a decade after he headed his Hunan raw 
recruits, he succeeded in reducing the wide dev- 
astations of the rebellion that covered a terri- 
torial area of three of the richest provinces of 
China to the single one of Kiang Nan, till finally, 
by the constriction of his forces, he succeeded in 
crushing the life out of the rebellion by the fall 
and capture of Nanking, The Taiping Rebel- 
lion was of fifteen years' duration, from 1850 to 
1865. It was no small task to bring it to its ex- 
tinction. Its rise and progress had cost the Em- 
pire untold treasures, while 25,000,000 human 
lives were immolated in that political hecatomb. 
The close of the great rebellion gave the people 
a breathing respite. The Dowager Empress had 
special reasons to be grateful to the genius of 
Tsang Kwoh Fan, who was instrumental in re- 
storing peace and order to the Manchu Dynasty. 
She was not slow, however, to recognize Tsang 
Kwoh Fan's merits and moral worth and created 
him a duke. But Tsang' s greatness was not to be 
measured by any degree of conventional nobility; 
it did not consist in his victories over the rebels, 
much less in his re-capture of Nanking* It rose 
from his great virtues: his pure, unselfish patriot- 
ism, his deep and far-sighted statesmanship, and 



148 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the purity of his official career. He is known in 
history as "the man of rectitude." This was his 
posthumous title conferred on him by imperial 
decree- 
To resume the thread of my story, I was near- 
ly two weeks in the viceroy's headquarters, oc- 
cupying a suite of rooms in the same building 
assigned to my Shanghai friends Li, Chang, 
Wha and Chu. There were living in his military 
headquarters at least two hundred officials, gath- 
ered there from all parts of the Empire, for va- 
rious objects and purposes. Besides his secre- 
taries, who numbered no less than a hundred, 
there were expectant officials, learned scholars, 
lawyers, mathematicians, astronomers and ma- 
chinists; in short, the picked and noted men of 
China were all drawn there by the magnetic 
force of his character and great name. He al- 
ways had a great admiration for men of distin- 
guished learning and talents, and loved to asso- 
ciate and mingle with them. During the two 
weeks of my sojourn there, I had ample oppor- 
tunity to call upon my Shanghai friends, and in 
that way incidentally found out what the object 
of the Viceroy was in urging me to be enrolled 
in the government service. It seemed that my 
friends had had frequent interviews with the 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 149 

Viceroy in regard to having a foreign machine 
shop established in China, but it had not been de- 
termined what kind of a machine shop should be 
established* One evening they gave me a dinner, 
at which time the subject of the machine shop 
was brought up and it became the chief topic. 
After each man had expressed his views on the 
subject excepting myself, they wanted to know 
what my views were, intimating that in all like- 
lihood in my next interview with the Viceroy he 
would bring up the subject. I said that as I was 
not an expert in the matter, my opinions or sug- 
gestions might not be worth much, but neverthe- 
less from my personal observation in the United 
States and from a common-sense point of view, 
I would say that a machine shop in the present 
state of China should be of a general and funda- 
mental character and not one for specific pur- 
poses. In other words, I told them they ought 
to have a machine shop that would be able to 
create or reproduce other machine shops of the 
same character as itself; each and all of these 
should be able to turn out specific machinery 
for the manufacture of specific things. In plain 
words, they would have to have general and 
fundamental machinery in order to turn out 
specific machinery. A machine shop consisting 



150 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

of lathes of different kinds and sizes, planers and 
drills would be able to turn out machinery for 
making guns, engines, agricultural implements, 
clocks, etc. In a large country like China, I told 
them, they would need many primary or funda- 
mental machine shops, but that after they had 
one (and a first-class one at that) they could 
make it the mother shop for reproducing others 
perhaps better and more improved. If they 
had a number of them, it would enable them to 
have the shops co-operate with each other in case 
of need. It would be cheaper to have them re- 
produced and multiplied in China, I said, where 
labor and material were cheaper, than in Europe 
and America. Such was my crude idea of the 
subject. After I had finished, they were appar- 
ently much pleased and interested, and expressed 
the hope that I would state the same views to the 
Viceroy if he should ask me about the subject. 
Several days after the dinner and conversation, 
the Viceroy did send for me. In this interview 
he asked me what in my opinion was the best 
thing to do for China at that time. The question 
came with such a force of meaning, that if I had 
not been f orwarned by my friends a few evenings 
before, or if their hearts had not been set on the 
introduction of a machine shop, and they had not 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 151 

practically won the Viceroy over to their pet 
scheme, I might have been strongly tempted to 
launch forth upon my educational scheme as a 
reply to the question as to what was the best thing 
to do for China. But in such an event, being a 
stranger to the Viceroy, having been brought to 
his notice simply through the influence of my 
friends, I would have run a greater risk of jeop- 
ardizing my pet scheme of education than if I 
were left to act independently. My obligations 
to them were great, and I therefore decided that 
my constancy and fidelity to their friendship 
should be correspondingly great. So, instead of 
finding myself embarrassed in answering such a 
large and important question, I had a precon- 
ceived answer to give, which seemed to dove-tail 
into his views already crystallized into definite 
form, and which was ready to be carried out at 
once. So my educational scheme was put in the 
background, and the machine shop was allowed 
to take precedence. I repeated in substance 
what I had said to my friends previously in re- 
gard to establishing a mother machine shop, capa- 
ble of reproducing other machine shops of like 
character, etc. I especially mentioned the manu- 
facture of rifles, which, I said, required for the 
manufacture of their component parts separate 



152 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

machinery, but that the machine shop I would 
recommend was not one adapted for making the 
rifles, but adapted to turn out specific machinery 
for the making of rifles, cannons, cartridges, or 
anything else. 

"Well," said he, "this is a subject quite beyond 
my knowledge. It would be well for you to dis- 
cuss the matter with Wha and Chu, who are 
more familiar with it than I am and we will 
then decide what is best to be done." 

This ended my interview with the Viceroy. 
After I left him, I met my friends, who were 
anxious to know the result of the interview. I 
told them of the outcome. They were highly 
elated over it. In our last conference it was 
decided that the matter of the character of the 
machine shop was to be left entirely to my dis- 
cretion and judgment, after consulting a profes- 
sional mechanical engineer. At the end of another 
two weeks, Wha was authorized to tell me that 
the Viceroy, after having seen all the four men, 
had decided to empower me to go abroad and 
make purchases of such machinery as in the opin- 
ion of a professional engineer would be the best 
and the right machinery for China to adopt. It 
was also left entirely to me to decide where the 
machinery should be purchased, either in Eng- 



INTERVIEWS WITH TSANG KWOH FAN 158 

land, France or the United States of America. 
The location of the machine shop was to be at 
a place called Kow Chang Meu, about four miles 
northwest of the city of Shanghai. The Kow 
Chang Meu machine shop was afterwards known 
as the Kiang Nan Arsenal, an establishment that 
covers several acres of ground and embraces 
under its roof all the leading branches of me- 
chanical work. Millions have been invested in it 
since I brought the first machinery from Fitch- 
burg, Mass., in order to make it one of the great- 
est arsenals east of the Cape of Good Hope. It 
may properly be regarded as a lasting monument 
to commemorate Tsang Kwoh Fan's broad- 
mindedness as well as far-sightedness in estab- 
lishing Western machinery in China.
