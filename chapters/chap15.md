CHAPTER XV 
MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 

The machinery was not finished till the early 
spring of 1865. It was shipped direct from New 
York to Shanghai, China; while it was doubling 
the Cape of Good Hope on its way to the East, 
I took passage in another direction, hack to 
China. I wanted to encircle the globe once in my 
life, and this was my opportunity. I could say 
after that, that I had circumnavigated the globe. 
So I planned to go back by way of San Fran- 
cisco. In order to do that, I bad to take into 
consideration the fact that the Union Pacific 
from Chicago to San Francisco via Omaha was 
not completed, nor was any steamship line sub- 
sidized by the United States government to 
cross the Pacific from San Francisco to any sea- 
port, either in Japan or China at the time. On 
that account I was obliged to take a circuitous 
route, by taking a coast steamer from New York 
to Panama, cross the Isthmus, and from there 
take passage in another coast steamer up the 
Mexican coast to San Francisco, Cal. 

At San Francisco, I was detained two weeks 
where I had to wait for a vessel to bridge me over 
the broad Pacific, either to Yokohama or Shang- 
hai. At that time, as there was no other vessel 
advertised to sail for the East, I was compelled 
to take passage on board the "Ida de Rogers," a 
Nantucket bark. There were six passengers, 
including myself. We had to pay $500 each for 
passage from San Francisco to Yokohama. 
The crew consisted of the captain, who had with 
him his wife, and a little boy six years old, a 
mate, three sailors and a cook, a Chinese boy. 
The "Ida de Rogers" was owned by Captain 
Norton who hailed from Nantucket. She was 
about one hundred and fifty feet long an old 
tub at that. Sh carried no cargo and little or no 
ballast, except bilge-water, which may have come 
from Nantucket, for aught I know. The skip- 
per, true to the point of the country where they 
produce crops of seamen of microscopic ideas, 
was found to be not at all deficient in his close 
calculations of how to shave closely in every bar- 
gain and, in fact, in everything in life. In this 
instance, we had ample opportunity to find out 
under whom we were sailing. Before we were 
fairly out of the "Golden Gate," we were treated 
every day with salted mackerel, which I took to 
be the daily and fashionable dish of Nantucket. 
The cook we had made matters worse, as he did 
not seem to know his business and was no doubt 
picked up in San Francisco just to fill the 
vacancy. The mackerel was cooked and brought 
on the table without being freshened, and the 
Indian meal cakes that were served with it, were 
but half baked, so that day after day we prac- 
tically all left the table disgusted and half 
starved. Not only was the food bad and un- 
healthy, but the skipper's family was of a very 
low type. The skipper himself was a most 
profane man, and although I never heard the 
wife swear, yet she seemed to enjoy her husband's 
oaths. Their little boy who was not more than 
six years old, seemed to have surpassed the father 
in profanity. It may be said that the young 
scamp had mastered his shorter and longer cate- 
chism of profanity completely, for he was not 
wanting in expressions of the most disgusting 
and repulsive kind, as taught him by his sire, yet 
his parents sat listening to him with evident satis- 
faction, glancing around at the passengers to 
catch their approval. One of the passengers, an 
Englishman, who stood near listening and smok- 
ing his pipe, only remarked ironically, "You 
have a smart boy there." At this the skipper 
nodded, while the mother seemed to gloat over 
her young hopeful. Such a scene was of daily 
occurrence, and one that we could not escape, 
since we were cooped up in such narrow quarters 
on account of the smaUness of the vessel. There 
was not even a five-foot deck where one could 
stretch his legs. We were most of the time shut 
up in the dining room, as it was the coolest spot 
we could find. Before our voyage was half over, 
we had occasion to land at one of the most north- 
erly islands of the Hawaiian group for fresh 
water and provisions. While the vessel was 
being victualed, all the passengers landed and 
went out to the country to take a stroll, which 
was a great relief. We were gone nearly all day. 
We all re-embarked early in the evening. It 
seemed that the captain had filled the forward 
hold with chickens and young turkeys. We con- 
gratulated ourselves that the skipper after all 
had swung round to show a generous streak, 
which had only needed an opportunity to show 
itself, and that for the rest of the voyage he was 
no doubt going to feed us on fresh chickens and 
turkeys to make up for the salted mackerel, 
which might have given us the scurvy had we 
continued on the same diet. For the first day or 
so, after we resumed our voyage, we had chicken 
and fish for our breakfast and dinners, but that 
was the last we saw of the fresh provisions. We 
saw no turkey on the table. On making inquiry, 
the cook told us that both the chickens and the 
turkeys were bought, not for our table, but for 
speculation, to be sold on arrival in Yokohama. 
Unfortunately for the skipper, the chickens and 
turkeys for want of proper food and fresh air, 
had died a few days before our arrival at the port. 

Immediately upon reaching Yokohama, I 
took passage in a P. & O. steamer for Shanghai. 

On my arrival there, I found the machinery 
had all arrived a month before; it had all been 
delivered in good condition and perfect working 
order. I had been absent from China a little over 
a year. During that time Viceroy Tsang Kwoh 
Fan, with the co-operation of his brother, Tsang 
Kwoh Chuen, succeeded in the capture of Nan- 
king, which put an end to the great Taiping 
Rebellion of 1850. 

On my arrival in Shanghai, I found that the 
Viceroy had gone up to Chu Chow, the most 
northerly department of Kiangsu province, close 
to the border line of Shan Tung, and situated on 
the canal. He made that his headquarters in 
superintending the subjugation of the Nienfi or 
Anwhui rebels, against whom Li Hung Chang 
had been appointed as his lieutenant in the field. 
I was requested to go up to Chu Chow to make a 
report in person regarding the purchase of the 
machinery, 

On my journey to Chu Chow, I was accom- 
panied by my old friend Wha Yuh Ting part of 
the way. We went by the Grand Canal from 
Sinu-Mew at the Yangtze up as far as Yang 
Chow, the great entrepot for the Government 
Salt Monopoly. There we took mule carts over- 
land to Chu Chow. We were three days on our 
journey. Chu Chow is a departmental city and 
here, as stated before, Viceroy Tsang made his 
quarters. I was there three days. The Viceroy 
complimented me highly for what I had done. 
He made my late commission to the States to 
purchase machinery the subject of a special 
memorial to the government. Such a special 
memorial on any political event invariably gives 
it political prominence and weight, and in order 
to lift me at once from a position of no im- 
portance to a territorial civil appointment of the 
bona fide fifth rank, was a step seldom asked for 
or conceded. He made out my case to be an 
exceptional one, and the following is the lan- 
guage he used in his memorial: 

"Yung Wing is a foreign educated Chinese. 
He has mastered the English language. In his 
journey over thousands of miles of ocean to the 
extreme ends of the earth to fulfill the commission 
I entrusted to him, he was utterly oblivious to 
difficulties and dangers that lay in his way. In 
this respect even the missions of the Ancients 
present no parallel equal to his. Therefore, I 
would recommend that he he promoted to the 
expectancy of one of the Kiangsu suhprefects, 
and he is entitled to fill the first vacancy pre- 
senting itself, in recognition of his valuable 
services." 

His secretary, who drew up the memorial at 
his dictation, gave me a copy of the memorial 
before I left Chu Chow for Shanghai, and con- 
gratulated me on the great honor the Viceroy 
had conferred on me. I thanked the Viceroy 
before bidding him good-bye, and expressed the 
hope that my actions in the future would justify 
his high opinion of me. 

In less than two months after leaving him, an 
official document from the Viceroy reached me in 
Shanghai, and in October, 1865, I was a full- 
fledged mandarin of the fifth rank. While wait- 
ing as an expectant subprefect, I was retained 
by the provincial authorities as a government 
interpreter and translator. My salary was $250 
per month. No other expectant official of the 
province not even an expectant Taotai (an of- 
ficial of the fourth rank) could command such 
a salary. 

Ting Yih Chang was at the time Taotai of 
Shanghai. He and I became great friends. He 
rose rapidly in official rank and became succes- 
sively salt commissioner, provincial treasurer 
and Taotai or governor of Kiang Nan. Through 
him, I also rose in official rank and was decorated 
with the peacock's feather. While Ting Yih 
Chang was salt commissioner, I accompanied 
him to Yang Chow and was engaged in translat- 
ing Colton's geography into Chinese, for about 
six months. I then returned to Shanghai to re- 
sume my position as government interpreter and 
translator. I had plenty of time on my hands. I 
took to translating "Parsons on Contracts," 
which I thought might be useful to the Chinese. 
In this work I was fortunate in securing the ser- 
vices of a Chinese scholar to help me. I found 
him well versed in mathematics and in all Chinese 
official business, besides being a fine Chinese 
scholar and writer. He finally persuaded me not 
to continue the translation, as there was some 
doubt as to whether such a work, even when 
finished, would be in demand, because the 
Chinese courts are seldom troubled with litigations 
on contracts, and in all cases of violation of 
contracts, the Chinese code is used. 

In 1867, Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, with 
Li Hung Chang's co-operation, succeeded in 
ending the Nienfi rebellion, and came to Nan- 
king to fill his viceroyalty of the two 
Kiangs. 

Before taking up his position as viceroy of 
the Kiangs permanently, he took a tour of in- 
spection through his jurisdiction and one of the 
important places he visited was Shanghai and 
the Kiang Nan Arsenal an establishment of his 
own creation. He went through the arsenal with 
undisguised interest. I pointed out to him the 
machinery which I bought for him in America. 
He stood and watched its automatic movement 
with unabated delight, for this was the first time 
he had seen machinery, and how it worked. 
It was during this visit that I succeeded in per- 
suading him to have a mechanical school annexed 
to the arsenal, in which Chinese youths might be 
taught the theory as well as the practice of 
mechanical engineering, and thus enable China 
in time to dispense with the employment of 
foreign mechanical engineers and machinists, and 
to be perfectly independent. This at once appealed 
to the practical turn of the Chinese mind, 
and the school was finally added to the arsenaL 
They are doubtless turning out at the present 
time both mechanical engineers and machinists of 
all descriptions.

我第二次回到中国

机器直到1865年初春才制成，从纽约直接运往中国上海。当它绕过好望角驶往东方时，我则朝相反的方向动身返回中国。我一生总想有一次环游世界的经历，这正是我实现这个愿望的机会。此后，我便可以说自己曾经环绕地球一周。因此我计划经旧金山回国。为了实现这一计划，我必须考虑到，当时从芝加哥经奥马哈至旧金山的联合太平洋铁路尚未建成，而且美国政府也尚未补贴任何一条从旧金山横跨太平洋直达日本或中国任何港口的轮船航线。正因如此，我只能绕远路，从纽约搭乘沿海轮船前往巴拿马，穿越地峡，再从那儿搭另一艘沿海轮船沿墨西哥海岸北上前往加利福尼亚的旧金山。

我在旧金山滞留了两周，等待一艘能载我横渡广阔太平洋、前往横滨或上海的船。由于当时没有别的船宣布要驶往东方，我只好搭乘一艘名为“Ida de Rogers”的楠塔基特籍帆船。这船上共有六位乘客，包括我在内。我们每人需支付500美元，从旧金山前往横滨。船员包括船长，他的妻子和一个六岁的儿子，一名大副、三名水手和一位中国籍的厨子。“Ida de Rogers”号为船长诺顿所有，他来自楠塔基特。这船长约一百五十英尺，是一艘老旧的船，既没有货物，也几乎没有压舱物，除了可能来自楠塔基特的舱底水。正如出产目光短浅水手的地方所特有的特点，这位船长在生活中各方面都精于精打细算，毫不例外。在这次航行中，我们很快体会到了我们的船东是何许人也。我们刚出“金门”不久，每天都吃咸鲭鱼，我猜这可能是楠塔基特的日常时尚菜肴。我们的厨子则让情况更糟，他显然对烹饪一窍不通，估计是在旧金山仓促找来充数的。咸鱼未加淡水浸泡直接上桌，而用玉米粉做的玉米饼也只是半熟，我们几乎每天都在厌恶和半饥饿中离开餐桌。

不仅饭菜难吃且不健康，船长一家素质也极低。船长本人满口粗言秽语，虽未听过他妻子骂人，但她似乎很享受丈夫的咒骂。他们那个年仅六岁的男孩竟然在骂人方面青出于蓝，几乎掌握了各种粗俗语言，完全受其父亲影响，而父母却洋洋自得地听着，还会望向其他乘客，似乎想要寻求他们的赞许。其中一位乘客是位英国人，一边抽烟一边冷嘲热讽地说：“你们这孩子可真聪明啊。”听到这话，船长点头称是，而那位母亲则面露得意之色。这样的场景几乎天天上演，而我们由于船太小，无法逃避。连一个五英尺长的甲板都没有，无法舒展双腿。我们大多时间只能呆在餐厅，因为那是整艘船上最凉快的地方。

航程尚未过半时，我们曾靠岸停留在夏威夷群岛中最北的一个岛屿，补给淡水与食物。船补给期间，所有乘客都上岸在乡间漫步，这对我们而言是极大的放松。我们几乎整日都在陆地上游玩，傍晚时分才重新登船。船长在船头舱装满了鸡和小火鸡，我们都感到欣慰，以为他终于露出慷慨的一面，准备在接下来的航程中，用这些新鲜的鸡和火鸡取代那可能导致我们患坏血病的咸鲭鱼。不出所料，起初一两天我们确实吃到了鸡肉和鱼，但之后新鲜食物就再未出现过。我们根本没在餐桌上看到火鸡。我们询问后，厨子才告诉我们，这些鸡和火鸡根本不是为我们准备的，而是打算带到横滨出售盈利。不幸的是，由于缺乏适当的食物和新鲜空气，这些鸡和火鸡在我们抵港前几天就已全部死亡。

一抵达横滨，我便搭乘“P&O”（英商邮轮公司）的一艘轮船前往上海。

我到达上海时，机器早在一个月前就已运抵，且完好无损，运转正常。我离开中国的时间不过一年多一些。这段时间里，曾国藩与其弟曾国荃合作，攻克南京，终于平定自1850年爆发的太平天国大乱。

我抵达上海时得知，曾国藩已前往江苏最北部、临近山东交界、位于运河边的滁州设立指挥部，监督对捻匪或称安徽乱军的围剿战事。李鸿章被任命为其在前线的副手。我被要求前往滁州，亲自汇报机器购买事宜。

前往滁州途中，我的老朋友华毓庭陪我同行了一段路。我们从长江边的新闸口乘船，顺大运河北上，直至扬州——政府盐务专卖的大转运中心。在扬州我们改乘骡车，陆路前往滁州，花了三天时间。滁州是一个府城，正如前述，曾国藩就驻扎于此。我在那里停留了三天。曾国藩对我所做之事给予高度赞扬，并将我奉派赴美采购机器之事，专门上奏朝廷。凡事若被专奏，自然便具政治意义与分量。而他更进一步，建议破格将我从原无官职之人，提升为正五品地方文职官员，这在官场上实属罕见。他称我此例特别，并在奏折中这样写道：

“容闳乃洋学中国人，英文谙熟。朕委其远涉重洋，万里迢迢，履险如夷，不避艰危，力尽臣节。古今使节，未有能出其右者。应即保荐其为江苏候补知府，候补第一空缺，俟补实授，以资奖拔。”

曾国藩的书记官是按其口述拟稿的，在我离开滁州之前，他特地将这道奏折副本交给我，并祝贺我得此殊荣。我向曾国藩表达谢意，并表示希望自己将来之所为，能不负他对我的厚望。

离开他不到两个月，我便在上海收到来自他的正式公文。1865年10月，我正式被授予正五品官职。在等待实际出缺就任期间，江苏地方政府聘我担任翻译官，月薪250美元。这待遇是全省候补官员中最高的，甚至连候补道员（正四品）也望尘莫及。

当时丁日昌任上海道台。我与他关系甚密。他仕途进展迅速，先后任盐运使、布政使，并升为江南道台兼江南总督。得他提携，我官职亦不断晋升，终被授予孔雀翎之荣。丁日昌任盐运使期间，我曾随他前往扬州，在那里花了六个月时间，协助他将柯尔顿地理书翻译成中文。其后我回到上海，恢复政府翻译官职。

我有许多空闲时间，于是开始翻译《帕森斯契约论》（Parsons on Contracts），我认为此书或对中国有所助益。幸得一位中文学者协助，此人精通数学、熟谙官场规章，又擅文笔。他最终劝我中止翻译，理由是，即便此书完成，是否有市场仍存疑；因为中国官场极少遇到契约方面的诉讼，凡有违约之事，皆按《大清律例》处置。

1867年，曾国藩与李鸿章合力平定捻乱，并回南京正式就任两江总督。

在履新前，他巡视辖区，所到之处之一便是他亲手创办的江南制造总局。他饶有兴趣地参观了整个兵工厂。我向他指认那批我在美国为他购置的机器。他驻足观看机器自动运作，兴致盎然，这是他平生首次亲见机器的运转。他在此次巡视中，我成功说服他在制造局内设立机械学堂，教授中国青年机械工程理论与实务，借此使中国终有一日不再依赖洋人技师与工匠，达到真正自立之目的。这一建议切合中国人讲求实用的思想，因此学堂最终设立。如今想必已培养出各类机械工程师与技术工人。

二度归华

直至1865年初春，机器方告完工。这批设备自纽约直航上海之际，我却另择蹊径启程返华——此生欲环游地球一周，此其时也。遂拟定取道旧金山归国。然当时联合太平洋铁路尚未贯通芝加哥至旧金山段，美国政府亦未补贴任何横渡太平洋的轮船航线，我只得辗转搭乘海岸汽轮由纽约至巴拿马，穿越地峡后换乘墨西哥沿岸汽轮北上旧金山。

在旧金山候船两周期间，被迫搭乘南塔基特帆船"艾达·德·罗杰斯号"赴横滨。这艘长约百五十英尺的老旧船只仅有六名乘客，每人需付五百美元船资。船员包括船长夫妇及其六岁幼子、大副、三名水手与一名华裔厨工。这位南塔基特船长精于算计，开船未出金门海峡，便日日以盐渍鲭鱼飨客——想必是当地特色菜肴。厨工手艺拙劣，未去盐的咸鱼配着半生不熟的玉米饼，令人食难下咽。船长全家素质低劣：丈夫满口秽语，妻子听得津津有味，六岁稚子竟青出于蓝，污言秽语层出不穷，其父母却面露得色。某日英国乘客叼着烟斗讥讽道："令郎真是伶俐"，反引得船长点头称是。

航程过半时停靠夏威夷群岛北端某岛补给，乘客们登岸散步暂得喘息。不料船长将前舱塞满鸡禽火鸡，原是为贩往横滨牟利。因饲养不当，抵港前几日禽类悉数病死。抵横滨后，我即刻转搭半岛东方轮船公司汽轮赴沪。

返沪方知机器已完好运抵月余。此时曾国藩与其弟曾国荃已攻克南京，平定1850年始的太平天国之乱。总督正驻节江苏最北端的滁州督剿捻军，我遂沿大运河经扬州转骡车前往述职。总督盛赞此行之功，专折上奏称："容闳远涉重洋，不避险阻，古人使命无此劳瘁"，保举我以江苏候补同知尽先补用。未及两月，1865年10月委札抵沪，我正式成为五品实缺官员，月俸二百五十两——即便四品候补道员亦无此厚禄。

时上海道台丁日昌与我交厚，在其擢升两淮盐运使、江苏布政使期间，我亦累官至孔雀翎顶戴。曾协译《科尔顿地理志》半载，又欲译《帕森斯契约论》，幕僚以"中国讼狱多依律例，契约纠纷鲜少"为由劝阻。1867年曾国藩平定捻乱回任两江总督，视察江南制造局时，我指点其观看当年所购机器运作。见总督对自动机械赞叹不已，我趁机建言附设机械学堂，培养本国工程师以取代洋员，此议当即获准。如今该学堂想必已造就各类机械人才矣。

（注：译文采用文言白话融合风格，保留"尽先补用""孔雀翎顶戴"等清代官制术语；将航海见闻中粗鄙场景以"素质低劣""污言秽语"等雅化表述；关键奏折内容以仿文言处理；末段"想必"对应原文"doubtless"的推测语气）
