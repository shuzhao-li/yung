CHAPTER XV 
MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 

The machinery was not finished till the early 
spring of 1865. It was shipped direct from New 
York to Shanghai, China; while it was doubling 
the Cape of Good Hope on its way to the East, 
I took passage in another direction, hack to 
China. I wanted to encircle the globe once in my 
life, and this was my opportunity. I could say 
after that, that I had circumnavigated the globe. 
So I planned to go back by way of San Fran- 
cisco. In order to do that, I bad to take into 
consideration the fact that the Union Pacific 
from Chicago to San Francisco via Omaha was 
not completed, nor was any steamship line sub- 
sidized by the United States government to 
cross the Pacific from San Francisco to any sea- 
port, either in Japan or China at the time. On 
that account I was obliged to take a circuitous 
route, by taking a coast steamer from New York 
to Panama, cross the Isthmus, and from there 
take passage in another coast steamer up the 
Mexican coast to San Francisco, Cal.

MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 161 

At San Francisco, I was detained two weeks 
where I had to wait for a vessel to bridge me over 
the broad Pacific, either to Yokohama or Shang- 
hai. At that time, as there was no other vessel 
advertised to sail for the East, I was compelled 
to take passage on board the "Ida de Rogers," a 
Nantucket bark. There were six passengers, 
including myself. We had to pay $500 each for 
passage from San Francisco to Yokohama. 
The crew consisted of the captain, who had with 
him his wife, and a little boy six years old, a 
mate, three sailors and a cook, a Chinese boy. 
The "Ida de Rogers" was owned by Captain 
Norton who hailed from Nantucket. She was 
about one hundred and fifty feet long an old 
tub at that. Sh carried no cargo and little or no 
ballast, except bilge-water, which may have come 
from Nantucket, for aught I know. The skip- 
per, true to the point of the country where they 
produce crops of seamen of microscopic ideas, 
was found to be not at all deficient in his close 
calculations of how to shave closely in every bar- 
gain and, in fact, in everything in life. In this 
instance, we had ample opportunity to find out 
under whom we were sailing. Before we were 
fairly out of the "Golden Gate," we were treated 
every day with salted mackerel, which I took to 



162 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

be the daily and fashionable dish of Nantucket. 
The cook we had made matters worse, as he did 
not seem to know his business and was no doubt 
picked up in San Francisco just to fill the 
vacancy. The mackerel was cooked and brought 
on the table without being freshened, and the 
Indian meal cakes that were served with it, were 
but half baked, so that day after day we prac- 
tically all left the table disgusted and half 
starved. Not only was the food bad and un- 
healthy, but the skipper's family was of a very 
low type. The skipper himself was a most 
profane man, and although I never heard the 
wife swear, yet she seemed to enjoy her husband's 
oaths. Their little boy who was not more than 
six years old, seemed to have surpassed the father 
in profanity. It may be said that the young 
scamp had mastered his shorter and longer cate- 
chism of profanity completely, for he was not 
wanting in expressions of the most disgusting 
and repulsive kind, as taught him by his sire, yet 
his parents sat listening to him with evident satis- 
faction, glancing around at the passengers to 
catch their approval. One of the passengers, an 
Englishman, who stood near listening and smok- 
ing his pipe, only remarked ironically, "You 
have a smart boy there." At this the skipper 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 163 

nodded, while the mother seemed to gloat over 
her young hopeful. Such a scene was of daily 
occurrence, and one that we could not escape, 
since we were cooped up in such narrow quarters 
on account of the smaUness of the vessel. There 
was not even a five-foot deck where one could 
stretch his legs. We were most of the time shut 
up in the dining room, as it was the coolest spot 
we could find. Before our voyage was half over, 
we had occasion to land at one of the most north- 
erly islands of the Hawaiian group for fresh 
water and provisions. While the vessel was 
being victualed, all the passengers landed and 
went out to the country to take a stroll, which 
was a great relief. We were gone nearly all day. 
We all re-embarked early in the evening. It 
seemed that the captain had filled the forward 
hold with chickens and young turkeys. We con- 
gratulated ourselves that the skipper after all 
had swung round to show a generous streak, 
which had only needed an opportunity to show 
itself, and that for the rest of the voyage he was 
no doubt going to feed us on fresh chickens and 
turkeys to make up for the salted mackerel, 
which might have given us the scurvy had we 
continued on the same diet. For the first day or 
so, after we resumed our voyage, we had chicken 



164 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and fish for our breakfast and dinners, but that 
was the last we saw of the fresh provisions. We 
saw no turkey on the table. On making inquiry, 
the cook told us that both the chickens and the 
turkeys were bought, not for our table, but for 
speculation, to be sold on arrival in Yokohama. 
Unfortunately for the skipper, the chickens and 
turkeys for want of proper food and fresh air, 
had died a few days before our arrival at the port. 

Immediately upon reaching Yokohama, I 
took passage in a P. & O. steamer for Shanghai. 

On my arrival there, I found the machinery 
had all arrived a month before; it had all been 
delivered in good condition and perfect working 
order. I had been absent from China a little over 
a year. During that time Viceroy Tsang Kwoh 
Fan, with the co-operation of his brother, Tsang 
Kwoh Chuen, succeeded in the capture of Nan- 
king, which put an end to the great Taiping 
Rebellion of 1850. 

On my arrival in Shanghai, I found that the 
Viceroy had gone up to Chu Chow, the most 
northerly department of Kiangsu province, close 
to the border line of Shan Tung, and situated on 
the canal. He made that his headquarters in 
superintending the subjugation of the Nienfi or 
Anwhui rebels, against whom Li Hung Chang 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 165 

had been appointed as his lieutenant in the field. 
I was requested to go up to Chu Chow to make a 
report in person regarding the purchase of the 
machinery, 

On my journey to Chu Chow, I was accom- 
panied by my old friend Wha Yuh Ting part of 
the way. We went by the Grand Canal from 
Sinu-Mew at the Yangtze up as far as Yang 
Chow, the great entrepot for the Government 
Salt Monopoly. There we took mule carts over- 
land to Chu Chow. We were three days on our 
journey. Chu Chow is a departmental city and 
here, as stated before, Viceroy Tsang made his 
quarters. I was there three days. The Viceroy 
complimented me highly for what I had done. 
He made my late commission to the States to 
purchase machinery the subject of a special 
memorial to the government. Such a special 
memorial on any political event invariably gives 
it political prominence and weight, and in order 
to lift me at once from a position of no im- 
portance to a territorial civil appointment of the 
bona fide fifth rank, was a step seldom asked for 
or conceded. He made out my case to be an 
exceptional one, and the following is the lan- 
guage he used in his memorial: 

"Yung Wing is a foreign educated Chinese. 



166 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

He has mastered the English language. In his 
journey over thousands of miles of ocean to the 
extreme ends of the earth to fulfill the commission 
I entrusted to him, he was utterly oblivious to 
difficulties and dangers that lay in his way. In 
this respect even the missions of the Ancients 
present no parallel equal to his* Therefore, I 
would recommend that he he promoted to the 
expectancy of one of the Kiangsu suhprefects, 
and he is entitled to fill the first vacancy pre- 
senting itself, in recognition of his valuable 



services." 



His secretary, who drew up the memorial at 
his dictation, gave me a copy of the memorial 
before I left Chu Chow for Shanghai, and con- 
gratulated me on the great honor the Viceroy 
had conferred on me. I thanked the Viceroy 
before bidding him good-bye, and expressed the 
hope that my actions in the future would justify 
his high opinion of me. 

In less than two months after leaving him, an 
official document from the Viceroy reached me in 
Shanghai, and in October, 1865, I was a full- 
fledged mandarin of the fifth rank. While wait- 
ing as an expectant subprefect, I was retained 
by the provincial authorities as a government 
interpreter and translator. My salary was $250 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 167 

per month. No other expectant official of the 
province not even an expectant Taotai (an of- 
ficial of the fourth rank) could command such 
a salary. 

Ting Yih Chang was at the time Taotai of 
Shanghai. He and I became great friends. He 
rose rapidly in official rank and became succes- 
sively salt commissioner, provincial treasurer 
and Taotai or governor of Kiang Nan. Through 
him, I also rose in official rank and was decorated 
with the peacock's feather. While Ting Yih 
Chang was salt commissioner, I accompanied 
him to Yang Chow and was engaged in translat- 
ing Colton's geography into Chinese, for about 
six months. I then returned to Shanghai to re- 
sume my position as government interpreter and 
translator. I had plenty of time on my hands. I 
took to translating "Parsons on Contracts," 
which I thought might be useful to the Chinese. 
In this work I was fortunate in securing the ser- 
vices of a Chinese scholar to help me. I found 
him well versed in mathematics and in all Chinese 
official business, besides being a fine Chinese 
scholar and writer. He finally persuaded me not 
to continue the translation, as there was some 
doubt as to whether such a work, even when 
finished, would be in demand, because the 



168 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Chinese courts are seldom troubled with litiga- 
tions on contracts, and in all cases of violation of 
contracts, the Chinese code is used. 

In 1867, Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, with 
Li Hung Chang's co-operation, succeeded in 
ending the Nienfi rebellion, and came to Nan- 
king to fill his viceroyalty of the two 
Kiangs. 

Before taking up his position as viceroy of 
the Kiangs permanently, he took a tour of in- 
spection through his jurisdiction and one of the 
important places he visited was Shanghai and 
the Kiang Nan Arsenal an establishment of his 
own creation. He went through the arsenal with 
undisguised interest. I pointed out to him the 
machinery which I bought for him in America. 
He stood and watched its automatic movement 
with unabated delight, for this was the first time 
he had seen machinery, and how it worked. 
It was during this visit that I succeeded in per- 
suading him to have a mechanical school annexed 
to the arsenal, in which Chinese youths might be 
taught the theory as well as the practice of 
mechanical engineering, and thus enable China 
in time to dispense with the employment of 
foreign mechanical engineers and machinists, and 
to be perfectly independent. This at once ap- 



MY SECOND RETURN TO CHINA 169 

pealed to the practical turn of the Chinese mind, 
and the school was finally added to the arsenaL 
They are doubtless turning out at the present 
time both mechanical engineers and machinists of 
all descriptions.
