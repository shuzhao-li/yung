CHAPTER IV 
AT MONSON ACADEMY 

We were in East Windsor for about a week; 
then we went up to Monson, Mass., to enter the 
Academy there. Monson Academy was, at one 
time, quite a noted preparatory school in New 
England, before high schools sprang into 
existence. Young men from all parts of the 
country were found here, undergoing prepara- 
tion for colleges. It was its fortune, at different 
periods of its history, to have had men of 
character and experience for its principals. The 
Rev. Charles Hammond was one of them. He 
was in every sense a self-made man. He 
was a graduate of Yale; he was enthusiasti- 
cally fond of the classics, and a great admirer 
of English literature. He was a man of 
liberal views and broad sympathies. He 
was well-known in New England as an educator 
and a champion of temperance and New Eng- 
land virtues. His high character gave the 
Academy a wide reputation and the school was 
never in a more prosperous condition than when 
he was principal. He took a special interest in 
us, the three Chinese students Wong Shing, 
Wong Foon and myself not so much from the 
novelty of having Chinese in the school as from 
his interest in China,, and the possible good that 
might come out of our education. 

In our first year in the Academy, we were 
placed in the English department. Greenleaf s 
Arithmetic, English Grammar, Physiology, and 
Upham's Mental Philosophy were our studies. 
In the last two studies we recited to the new 
preceptress, Miss Rebekah Brown, a graduate 
of Mt. Holyoke, the valedictorian of her class. 
She afterwards became the wife of Doctor A. S. 
McClean, of Springfield, Mass. She was a fine 
teacher and a woman of exceptional Christian 
virtues. She had an even and sweet temper, and 
was full of good will and good works. She and 
her husband, the good Doctor, took a genuine 
interest in me; they gave me a home during some 
of my college vacations, and helped me in various 
ways in my struggle through Yale. I kept 
up my correspondence with them after my 
return to China, and upon my coming back to 
this country, I was always cordially invited to 
their home in Springfield. It was on account 
of such a genuine friendship that I made Springfield 
my headquarters in 1872, when I brought 
the first installment of Government students to 
this country. 

Brown placed us under the care of his mother, 
Mrs. Phoebe EL Brown. We boarded with her, 
but had a separate room assigned us in a dwelling 
right across the road, opposite to her 
cottage. Her widowed daughter with her three 
boys had taken up all the spare rooms in the 
cottage, which accounts for the want of accommo- 
dation for us. 

In those primitive days, board and lodging in 
the country were very reasonable. Indigent 
students had a fair chance to work their way for 
an education. I remember we paid for board 
and lodging, including fuel, light and washing, 
only $1.25 a week for each, but we had to take 
care of our own rooms and, in the winter, saw 
and split our own wood, which we found to be 
capital exercise. 

Our lodging was about half a mile from the 
academy. We had to walk three times a day to 
school and back, in the dead of winter when the 
snow was three feet deep ; that gave us plenty of 
exercise, keen appetites and kept us in fine con- 
dition. 

I look back upon my acquaintance with Mrs. 
Phoebe H. Brown with a mingled feeling of 
respect and admiration. She certainly was a 
remarkable New England woman a woman of 
surpassing strength of moral and religious 
character. Those who have had the rare privilege 
of reading her stirring biography, will, I am 
sure, bear me out in this statement. She went 
through the crucible of unprecedented adversi- 
ties and trials of life and came out one of the 
rare shining lights that beautify the New Eng- 
land sky. She is the authoress of the well-known 
hymn, "I love to steal awhile away from every 
cumbering care," etc., which breathes the calm 
spirit of contentment and resignation wherever 
sung. 

The Rev. Charles Hammond, the principal 
of the academy when we joined it, was a grad- 
uate of Yale, as I stated before, and a man of 
a fine cultivated taste* He was an enthusiastic 
admirer of Shakespeare, who was his favorite 
poet; among orators, he was partial to Daniel 
Webster, He had the faculty of inspiring his 
pupils with the love of the beautiful, both in 
ancient and modern literature. In our daily 
recitations, he laid a greater stress on pointing 
out the beauties of a sentence and its construc- 
tion, than he did on grammatical rules, moods 
and tenses. He was a fine writer. His addresses 
and sermons were pointed and full of life. Like 
Dr. Arnold of Rugby, he aimed to build char- 
acter in his pupils and not to convert them into 
walking encyclopedias, or intelligent parrots. 
It was through him that I was introduced to 
Addison, Goldsmith, Dickens, Sir Walter Scott, 
the Edinburgh Reviews, Macaulay and Shake- 
speare, which formed the bulk of my reading 
while in Monson. 

During my first year in the Monson Academy, 
I had no idea of taking a collegiate course. It 
was well understood that I was to return to 
China at the end of 1849, and the appropriation 
was made to suit such a plan. In the fall of 
1848, after Wong Shing the eldest of the three 
of us had returned to China on account of his 
poor health, Wong Foon and myself, who were 
left behind to continue our studies for another 
year, frequently met to talk over future plans 
for the end of the prescribed time. We both 
decided finally to stay in this country to continue 
our studies, but the question arose, who was 
going to back us financially after 1849? This 
was the Gordian Knot. We concluded to consult 
Mr. Hammond and Mr. Brown on the subject. 
They both decided to have the matter referred to 
our patrons in Hong Kong. Reply came that 
if we wished to prosecute our studies after 1849, 
they would be willing to continue their support 
through a professional course, if we were willing 
to go over to Scotland to go through the 
University of Edinburgh. This was a generous and 
noble-hearted proposal. 

Wong Foon, on his part, after much deliberation, 
decided to accept the offer and go over to 
Scotland at the end of 1849, while, on my part, 
I preferred to remain in this country to continue 
my studies here with the view of going to Yale. 
Wong Foon's decision had relieved him of all 
financial anxieties, while the problem of how I 
was to pay my education bills after 1849, still 
remained to be solved. But I did not allow the 
perplexites of the future to disturb my peace of 
mind. I threw all my anxieties to the wind, 
trusting to a wise Providence to care for my 
future, as it had done for my past. 

Wong Foon and I, having taken our decisive 
steps, dropped our English studies at the close 
of the school year of 1849, and in the fall of the 
same year we began the A B C's of our classical 
course. In the summer of 1850, we graduated 
from the academy. Wong Foon, by previous 
arrangements, went over to Scotland and 
entered the University of Edinburgh. I remained 
in this country and finally entered Yale. 
It was fully a decade since we had met for the 
first time in the Morrison School in Macao, in 
1840, to become school-mates as well as class- 
mates. Now that link was broken. 

Wong was in the University seven years. 
After completing his professional studies as a 
doctor, he returned to China in 1857. He was 
a fine scholar. He graduated the third man in 
Ms medical class. He also distinguished himself 
in his profession. His ability and skill secured 
for him an enviable reputation as one of the 
ablest surgeons east of the Cape of Good Hope 
at that time. He had a fine practice in Canton, 
where the foreign residents retained him as their 
physician in preference to European doctors. 
He was very successful and made quite a fortune 
before his death, which took place in 1879. Both 
the native and foreign communities felt his loss. 
He was highly respected and honored by Chinese 
and foreigners for his Christian character and 
the purity of his life.

第四章
蒙森学院时期

我们在东温莎大约待了一周左右，然后前往马萨诸塞州的蒙森，进入那里的学院。蒙森学院在新英格兰曾是颇负盛名的预备学校，那时普通高中尚未普及。来自全国各地的青年聚集于此，为进入大学做准备。在其历史的不同时期，该学院都曾由品格高尚、经验丰富的人士担任校长。查尔斯·哈蒙德牧师就是其中之一。他完全是自学成才，毕业于耶鲁大学，对古典文学充满热情，同时也是英国文学的热爱者。他思想开明，富有同情心，是新英格兰著名的教育家和节制运动倡导者，其高尚的人格为学院赢得了广泛声誉。学院在他担任校长期间，处于最为兴盛的时期。他对我们三位中国学生——黄胜、黄寬和我本人——格外关心，这并非出于新奇感，而是源于他对中国的关切以及对我们教育可能带来的益处的认同。

在我们进入学院的第一年，我们被安排在英文系学习。我们的课程包括格林利夫的《算术》、英文语法、人体生理学以及厄普汉的《心理哲学》。后两门课程由新来的女教师丽贝卡·布朗小姐教授，她是圣山霍利奥克学院的毕业生，并担任其毕业班的告别致辞人。后来她嫁给了马萨诸塞州斯普林菲尔德的麦克林医生。她是一位出色的教师，也是具有非凡基督教美德的女性。她性情温和、心地善良、乐于行善。她和她那位仁爱的丈夫都对我十分关心，在我大学假期期间多次接纳我在他们家中居住，并在我就读耶鲁期间给予我各种帮助。我回中国后仍与他们保持通信。每次重返美国，总会受到他们在斯普林菲尔德的热情邀请。正是因为这段真挚的友谊，我在1872年带首批官派留学生来美时，选择以斯普林菲尔德为我的基地。

布朗先生将我们托付给他母亲菲比·E·布朗夫人照顾。我们寄宿在她家，但住处安排在她小屋对面马路上的另一所房屋内。因为她那位丧偶的女儿带着三个男孩占用了小屋所有多余的房间，所以无法再容纳我们。

在那个质朴的年代，乡村的食宿费用极为低廉。贫寒学生也有机会通过勤工俭学完成学业。我记得我们每人每周只需支付1.25美元，就可包括食宿、取暖、照明和洗衣，但我们必须自己打扫房间，冬天还要自己锯木、劈柴，这些也成了很好的锻炼方式。

我们的住所离学院大约半英里。即使在冬季积雪三尺的严寒天气里，我们每天也需三次往返步行上学。这使我们得到了充分的锻炼，胃口大开，身体始终保持良好状态。

回想与菲比·H·布朗夫人的交往，我内心充满了敬意与钦佩。她确实是一位杰出的新英格兰女性，具备非凡的道德与宗教品格。那些有幸读过她感人传记的人，我相信都会认同我的评价。她经历了前所未有的逆境与人生考验，却像烈火中提炼出的金子，成为照亮新英格兰天空的一道稀有光芒。她创作了著名圣诗《我愿偷得片刻安宁，摆脱世间烦扰》等，歌中那份宁静的知足与顺从之情，至今仍能令人动容。

查尔斯·哈蒙德牧师，也就是我们入学时的校长，正如我前面提到的，是耶鲁毕业生，也是一位极富修养的绅士。他是莎士比亚的热情崇拜者，将其列为最爱的诗人；在演说家中，他偏爱丹尼尔·韦伯斯特。他具有激发学生热爱古今文学之美的天赋。在日常课业中，他更重视句子之美与结构，而非拘泥于语法规则、语态与时态。他文笔极佳，所写讲辞与布道稿都极富感染力。正如拉格比学校的阿诺德博士一样，他致力于培养学生的人格，而非让他们成为行走的百科全书或善于背诵的鹦鹉。正是通过他，我接触到了艾迪生、哥尔德史密斯、狄更斯、沃尔特·司各特、《爱丁堡评论》、麦考莱以及莎士比亚——这些构成了我在蒙森时期的主要阅读内容。

在蒙森学院的第一年，我并未考虑进入大学深造。大家都知道我将在1849年底返回中国，资助也只计划到那时。1848年秋天，我们三人中年纪最长的黄胜因健康问题返回中国，只剩我和黄寬继续学习。我们经常讨论既定学业结束后的未来打算，最终我们都决定留在美国继续深造，但随之而来的问题是——1849年之后，谁来资助我们？这成了我们难以解开的死结。于是我们决定请教哈蒙德先生和布朗先生。他们商议后决定将问题提交给香港方面的资助人。回复称，如果我们愿意继续深造，并愿意前往苏格兰入读爱丁堡大学，他们愿意继续提供资金支持。这是一个慷慨而高尚的提议。

黄寬经过深思熟虑后，决定接受这个提议，并在1849年底前往苏格兰。我则更希望留在美国继续求学，目标是进入耶鲁大学。黄寬的决定让他无需再为经济担忧，而我则仍需设法解决1849年以后的教育开销问题。但我并未让未来的不确定性扰乱内心的平静，我将所有焦虑抛诸脑后，相信上天既然照料了我的过去，也必会引领我的将来。

我们两人既已下定决心，便在1849年学年结束时放弃英文课程，并在同年秋季开始古典课程的启蒙学习。1850年夏天，我们从学院毕业。黄寬按照原定计划前往苏格兰，进入爱丁堡大学，而我则留在美国，最终进入耶鲁。从我们1840年在澳门马礼逊学校初次相识、成为学伴和同窗，至今整整十年，如今这一纽带终告分离。

黄寬在爱丁堡大学学习了七年，完成医学专业课程后于1857年返回中国。他是一位才学出众的学者，在医学班中排名第三，后来也在医学领域卓有成就。他的专业能力和技术为他赢得了“好望角以东最出色外科医生之一”的盛誉。他在广州的医务实践非常成功，甚至受到外国侨民的信赖，宁愿聘请他担任私人医生，而不是选择欧洲医生。他事业有成，积累了相当可观的财富，直至1879年去世。他的逝世令中外社群都深感惋惜。他因其基督徒的品格和高洁的生活方式，受到中外人士的高度尊重与敬仰。

第四章 蒙森学院记趣

我们在东温莎小住一周后，便前往马萨诸塞州的蒙森学院就读。这所新英格兰地区著名的预科学校，在公立中学尚未兴起的年代，曾培育过无数准备升入大学的青年。时任校长查尔斯·哈蒙德牧师是位典型的自我成就者——这位耶鲁毕业生对古典文学的热忱，恰如他推崇莎士比亚与丹尼尔·韦伯斯特那般炽热。在我们这三个中国少年身上，他倾注的不仅是猎奇心理，更寄托着对中国未来的期许。

第一学年里，我们主修格林利夫算术、英语语法、生理学及厄珀姆心理学。后两门课程由霍利奥克山学院毕业的丽贝卡·布朗小姐讲授，这位后来成为斯普林菲尔德医师夫人的女教师，以春风化雨般的教导成为我耶鲁求学时的贵人。每逢假期，她与丈夫总为我提供栖身之所；1872年我率首批留美幼童抵美时，斯普林菲尔德更成为我们的临时总部。

我们寄宿在布朗牧师的母亲菲比·布朗夫人家中。这位创作了著名赞美诗《偷闲片刻》的新英格兰女性，其传记中记载的坚韧品格令人动容。每周1.25美元的食宿费包含燃料与洗衣，但需自行劈柴——深冬时节踏着三尺积雪每日三次往返半英里外的学院，倒造就了我们强健的体魄。

哈蒙德先生的教学独具匠心：他更愿引导学生品味艾迪生散文的韵律、狄更斯小说的肌理，而非机械灌输语法规则。正是在他启迪下，我遍读《爱丁堡评论》与麦考利史学著作，莎士比亚戏剧更成为枕边常备。1848年秋，当最年长的黄胜因病返华后，我与黄宽常彻夜商讨前途。香港资助人传来佳讯：若愿赴爱丁堡大学深造，将继续提供资助。黄宽最终选择北上苏格兰，而我决意留在美国冲刺耶鲁——这个看似冲动的决定，使得1840年马礼逊学堂初遇的同窗，在1850年夏天各奔前程。

黄宽在爱丁堡苦读七载，以医科第三名的成绩毕业。1857年归国后，这位好望角以东最出色的外科医师，在广州中外医界赢得极高声誉。1879年他逝世时，纯净的基督徒品格使其获得了超越种族界限的哀荣。而我，则将在下一章讲述纽黑文的故事。

（译文说明：1. 将原文四段重组为五个叙事单元，以"教育-生活-抉择"为主线；2. 关键人物如哈蒙德校长通过莎士比亚等细节立体化；3. 文化意象如《偷闲片刻》采用诗化处理；4. 重要数据"1.25美元"保留以体现历史真实；5. 黄宽成就以"好望角以东"的地理概念强化表现力；6. 末段预留悬念实现章节衔接）
