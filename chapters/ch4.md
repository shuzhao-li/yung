CHAPTER IV 
AT MONSON ACADEMY 

We were in East Windsor for about a week; 
then we went up to Monson, Mass., to enter the 
Academy there. Monson Academy was, at one 
time, quite a noted preparatory school in New 
England, before high schools sprang into 
existence. Young men from all parts of the 
country were found here, undergoing prepara- 
tion for colleges. It was its fortune, at different 
periods of its history, to have had men of 
character and experience for its principals. The 
Rev. Charles Hammond was one of them. He 
was in every sense a self-made man. He 
was a graduate of Yale; he was enthusiasti- 
cally fond of the classics, and a great admirer 
of English literature. He was a man of 
liberal views and broad sympathies. He 
was well-known in New England as an educator 
and a champion of temperance and New Eng- 
land virtues. His high character gave the 
Academy a wide reputation and the school was 
never in a more prosperous condition than when

he was principal. He took a special interest in 
us, the three Chinese students Wong Shing, 
Wong Foon and myself not so much from the 
novelty of having Chinese in the school as from 
his interest in China,, and the possible good that 
might come out of our education. 

In our first year in the Academy, we were 
placed in the English department. Greenleaf s 
Arithmetic, English Grammar, Physiology, and 
Upham's Mental Philosophy were our studies. 
In the last two studies we recited to the new 
preceptress, Miss Rebekah Brown, a graduate 
of Mt. Holyoke, the valedictorian of her class. 
She afterwards became the wife of Doctor A. S. 
McClean, of Springfield, Mass. She was a fine 
teacher and a woman of exceptional Christian 
virtues. She had an even and sweet temper, and 
was full of good will and good works. She and 
her husband, the good Doctor, took a genuine 
interest in me; they gave me a home during some 
of my college vacations, and helped me in various 
ways in my struggle through Yale. I kept 
up my correspondence with them after my 
return to China, and upon my coming back to 
this country, I was always cordially invited to 
their home in Springfield. It was on account 
of such a genuine friendship that I made Spring-

field my headquarters in 1872, when I brought 
the first installment of Government students to 
this country. 

Brown placed us under the care of his mother, 
Mrs. Phoebe EL Brown. We boarded with her, 
but had a separate room assigned us in a dwell- 
ing right across the road, opposite to her 
cottage. Her widowed daughter with her three 
boys had taken up all the spare rooms in the 
cottage, which accounts for the want of accommo- 
dation for us. 

In those primitive days, board and lodging in 
the country were very reasonable. Indigent 
students had a fair chance to work their way for 
an education. I remember we paid for board 
and lodging, including fuel, light and washing, 
only $1.25 a week for each, but we had to take 
care of our own rooms and, in the winter, saw 
and split our own wood, which we found to be 
capital exercise. 

Our lodging was about half a mile from the 
academy. We had to walk three times a day to 
school and back, in the dead of winter when the 
snow was three feet deep ; that gave us plenty of 
exercise, keen appetites and kept us in fine con- 
dition. 

I look back upon my acquaintance with Mrs. 



30 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Phoebe H. Brown with a mingled feeling of 
respect and admiration. She certainly was a 
remarkable New England woman a woman of 
surpassing strength of moral and religious 
character. Those who have had the rare privilege 
of reading her stirring biography, will, I am 
sure, bear me out in this statement. She went 
through the crucible of unprecedented adversi- 
ties and trials of life and came out one of the 
rare shining lights that beautify the New Eng- 
land sky. She is the authoress of the well-known 
hymn, "I love to steal awhile away from every 
cumbering care," etc., which breathes the calm 
spirit of contentment and resignation wherever 
sung. 

The Rev. Charles Hammond, the principal 
of the academy when we joined it, was a grad- 
uate of Yale, as I stated before, and a man of 
a fine cultivated taste* He was an enthusiastic 
admirer of Shakespeare, who was his favorite 
poet; among orators, he was partial to Daniel 
Webster, He had the faculty of inspiring his 
pupils with the love of the beautiful, both in 
ancient and modern literature. In our daily 
recitations, he laid a greater stress on pointing 
out the beauties of a sentence and its construc- 
tion, than he did on grammatical rules, moods 



AT MONSON ACADEMY 31 

and tenses. He was a fine writer. His addresses 
and sermons were pointed and full of life. Like 
Dr. Arnold of Rugby, he aimed to build char- 
acter in his pupils and not to convert them into 
walking encyclopedias, or intelligent parrots. 
It was through him that I was introduced to 
Addison, Goldsmith, Dickens, Sir Walter Scott, 
the Edinburgh Reviews, Macaulay and Shake- 
speare, which formed the bulk of my reading 
while in Monson. 

During my first year in the Monson Academy, 
I had no idea of taking a collegiate course. It 
was well understood that I was to return to 
China at the end of 1849, and the appropriation 
was made to suit such a plan. In the fall of 
1848, after Wong Shing the eldest of the three 
of us had returned to China on account of his 
poor health, Wong Foon and myself, who were 
left behind to continue our studies for another 
year, frequently met to talk over future plans 
for the end of the prescribed time. We both 
decided finally to stay in this country to continue 
our studies, but the question arose, who was 
going to back us financially after 1849? This 
was the Gordian Knot. We concluded to consult 
Mr. Hammond and Mr. Brown on the subject. 
They both decided to have the matter referred to

our patrons in Hong Kong. Reply came that 
if we wished to prosecute our studies after 1849, 
they would be willing to continue their support 
through a professional course, if we were willing 
to go over to Scotland to go through the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh. This was a generous and 
noble-hearted proposal. 

Wong Foon, on his part, after much delibera- 
tion, decided to accept the offer and go over to 
Scotland at the end of 1849, while, on my part, 
I preferred to remain in this country to continue 
my studies here with the view of going to Yale. 
Wong Foon's decision had relieved him of all 
financial anxieties, while the problem of how I 
was to pay my education bills after 1849, still 
remained to be solved. But I did not allow the 
perplexites of the future to disturb my peace of 
mind. I threw all my anxieties to the wind, 
trusting to a wise Providence to care for my 
future, as it had done for my past. 

Wong Foon and I, having taken our decisive 
steps, dropped our English studies at the close 
of the school year of 1849, and in the fall of the 
same year we began the A B C's of our classical 
course. In the summer of 1850, we graduated 
from the academy. Wong Foon, by previous 
arrangements, went over to Scotland and 



AT MONSON ACADEMY 33 

entered the University of Edinburgh. I re- 
mained in this country and finally entered Yale. 
It was fully a decade since we had met for the 
first time in the Morrison School in Macao, in 
1840, to become school-mates as well as class- 
mates. Now that link was broken. 

Wong was in the University seven years. 
After completing his professional studies as a 
doctor, he returned to China in 1857. He was 
a fine scholar. He graduated the third man in 
Ms medical class. He also distinguished himself 
in his profession. His ability and skill secured 
for him an enviable reputation as one of the 
ablest surgeons east of the Cape of Good Hope 
at that time. He had a fine practice in Canton, 
where the foreign residents retained him as their 
physician in preference to European doctors. 
He was very successful and made quite a fortune 
before his death, which took place in 1879. Both 
the native and foreign communities felt his loss. 
He was highly respected and honored by Chinese 
and foreigners for his Christian character and 
the purity of his life.
