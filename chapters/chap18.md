CHAPTER XVIII 

INVESTIGATION OF THE COOLIE 
TRAFFIC IN PERU 

In the spring of 1873, I returned to China on 
a flying visit for the sole purpose of introducing 
the Catling gun a comparatively new weapon 
of warfare of a most destructive character. I 
had some difficulty in persuading the Gatling 
Company to give me the sole agency of the gun 
in China, hecause they did not know who I was, 
and were unacquainted with my practical busi- 
ness experience. In fact, they did not know how 
successfully I had carried on the Taiping Green 
Tea Expedition in 1860-1, in the face of dangers 
and privations which few men dared to face. 
However, I prevailed on the president of the 
company, Dr. Gatling himself, the inventor of 
the gun, to entrust me with the agency. Exactly 
a month after my arrival in Tientsin, I cabled 
the company an order for a battery of fifty guns, 
which amounted altogether to something over 
$100,000, a pretty big order for a man who it 
was thought could not do anything. This order 
was followed by subsequent orders. I was 
anxious that China should have the latest modern 
guns as well as the latest modern educated men. 
The Gatling Company was satisfied with my 
work and had a different opinion of me after- 
wards. 

While I was in Tientsin, attending to the gun 
business, the Viceroy told me that the Peruvian 
commissioner was there waiting to make a 
treaty with China regarding the further impor- 
tation of coolie labor into Peru. He wanted me 
to call on the commissioner and talk with him on 
the subject, which I did. In his conversation, 
he pictured to me in rosy colors how well the 
Chinese were treated in Peru; how they were 
prospering and doing well there, and said that the 
Chinese government ought to conclude a treaty 
with Peru to encourage the poorer class of 
Chinese to emigrate to that country, which 
offered a fine chance for them to better them- 
selves. I told him that I knew something about 
the coolie traffic as it was carried on in Macao; 
how the country people were inveigled and kid- 
napped, put into barracoons and kept there by 
force till they were shipped on board, where they 
were made to sign labor contracts either for 
Cuba or Peru. On landing at their destination, 
they were then sold to the highest bidder, and 
made to sign another contract with their new 
masters, who took special care to have the con- 
tract renewed at the end of every term, prac- 
tically making slaves of them for life. Then I 
told him something about the horrors of the 
middle passage between Macao and Cuba or 
Peru; how whole cargoes of them revolted in 
mid-ocean, and either committed wholesale sui- 
cide by jumping into the ocean, or else over- 
powered the captain and the crew, killed them 
and threw them overboard, and then took their 
chances in the drifting of the vessel. 

Such were some of the facts and horrors of 
the coolie traffic I pictured to the Peruvian Com- 
missioner. I told him plainly that he must not 
expect me to help him in this diabolical business. > 
On the contrary, I told him I would dissuade the 
Viceroy from entering into a treaty with Peru to 
carry on such inhuman traffic. How the Peru- 
vian's countenance changed when he heard me 
deliver my mind on the subject! Disappoint- 
ment, displeasure and anger were visible in his 
countenance. I bade him good morning, for I 
was myself somewhat excited as I narrated what 
I had seen in Macao and what I had read in the 
papers about the coolie traffic. Indeed, one of 
the first scenes I had seen on my arrival in Macao 
in 1855 was a string of poor Chinese coolies tied 
to each other hy their cues and led into one of the 
barracoons like abject slaves. Once, while in 
Canton, I had succeeded in having two or three 
kidnappers arrested, and had them put into 
wooden collars weighing forty pounds, which the 
culprits had to carry night and day for a couple 
of months as a punishment for their kidnapping. 

Returning to the Viceroy, I told him I had 
made the call, and narrated my interview. The 
Viceroy, to make my visit short, then said, "You 
have come back just in time to save me from 
cabling you. I wish you to return to Hartford 
as quickly as possible and make preparations to 
proceed to Peru at once, to look into the condition 
of the Chinese coolies there." 

On my return to Hartford, I found that Chin 
Lan Pin had also been instructed by the gov- 
ernment to look after the condition of the 
Chinese coolies in Cuba. These collateral or side 
missions were ordered at Li Hung Chang's sug- 
gestion. I started on my mission before Chin 
Lan Pin did. My friend, the Rev. J. H. 
Twichell, and Dr. E. W. Kellogg, who after- 
wards became my brother-in-law, accompanied 
me on my trip. I finished my work inside of 
three months, and had my report completed be- 
fore Chin started on his journey to Cuba. On 
his return, both of our reports were forwarded 
to Viceroy Li, who was in charge of all foreign 
diplomatic affairs. 

My report was accompanied with two dozen 
photographs of Chinese coolies, showing how 
their backs had been lacerated and torn, scarred 
and disfigured by the lash, I had these photo- 
graphs taken in the night, unknown to anyone 
except the victims themselves, who were, at my 
request, collected and assembled together for the 
purpose. I knew that these photographs would 
tell a tale of cruelty and inhumanity perpetrated 
by the owners of haciendas, which would be 
beyond cavil and dispute. 

The Peruvian Commissioner, who was sent out 
to China to negotiate a treaty with Viceroy Li 
Hung Chang to continue the coolie traffic to 
Peru, was still in Tientsin waiting for the arrival 
of my report. A friend of mine wrote me that 
he had the hardihood to deny the statements in 
my report, and said that they could not be sup- 
ported by facts. I had written to the Viceroy 
beforehand that he should hold the photographs 
in reserve, and keep them in the background till 
the Peruvian had exhausted all his arguments, 
and then produce them. My correspondent wrote 
me that the Viceroy followed my suggestion, and 
the photographs proved to be so incontrovertible 
and palpable that the Peruvian was taken by 
surprise and was dumbfounded. He retired 
completely crestfallen. 

Since our reports on the actual conditions of 
Chinese coolies in Cuba and Peru were made, 
no more coolies have been allowed to leave China 
for those countries. The traffic had received its 
death blow.

赴秘鲁调查华工贩运

1873年春，我为引进一种当时尚属新式、威力极强的武器——加特林机枪，而匆匆返回中国一趟。由于他们不认识我，也不了解我在商业上的实践经验，我在说服加特林公司授予我在中国的独家代理权时颇费了一番唇舌。实际上，他们并不知道我曾在1860至1861年间成功组织并完成了太平天国绿茶采购之行，那次行动面对着诸多危险和艰难困苦，是鲜有人敢于承担的。最终，我说服了公司总裁、也是加特林机枪发明者的加特林博士，将中国代理权交给我。就在我抵达天津整整一个月后，我便电报订购了一套由五十挺机枪组成的火力阵地，总价超过十万美元——这对一个原本被认为毫无作为的人来说，堪称一笔巨额订单。之后，我又陆续追加了多笔订单。我一直希望中国能同时拥有最先进的现代武器与最先进的现代教育人才。加特林公司对我的工作十分满意，从此对我刮目相看。

我在天津处理枪械事务时，总督告诉我，秘鲁派来的一位特使正在天津，意欲与中国政府签订一项新条约，以继续从中国输入苦力劳工。他希望我前去拜访这位特使，并与他就此事进行交谈，我也照办了。在交谈中，他绘声绘色地向我描绘华人在秘鲁受到良好待遇的情景，说他们在那里生活优渥、事业有成；他还说中国政府应当与秘鲁缔结条约，鼓励中国贫苦百姓移民秘鲁，因为那里是他们改善命运的绝佳去处。我告诉他，我对澳门的苦力贩运情况略知一二；乡下人被诱骗、绑架，关进苦力围栏（barracoons）中，靠暴力拘禁，待船只启航前才被押送登船。在船上，他们被迫签署所谓的劳工合同，目的地不是古巴就是秘鲁。一旦抵达当地，他们就会被转卖给出价最高的买主，再次签署新的合同。买主会特别安排，在每期合同到期时强迫他们续签，实际上就是把他们一辈子变成了奴隶。我还向他讲述了从澳门到古巴或秘鲁海上中途运输过程中的种种骇人听闻之事——整船人曾在大洋中集体暴动，不是集体跳海自尽，就是杀死船长与水手，将其尸体抛入海中，然后听天由命，任船漂流。

我将这些有关苦力贩运的事实与惨剧如实呈现给这位秘鲁特使。我坦言告知他，绝不要指望我会协助他从事这种罪恶勾当。相反，我还告诉他，我会劝阻总督，不要与秘鲁签订任何涉及此类非人道行为的条约。他听我讲完这番话时，脸色大变，失望、愤怒、不悦之情一览无遗。我向他道了声早安便离开了——我自己也因回忆起在澳门所见所闻以及在报纸上读到的苦力贩运报导而情绪激动。事实上，我1855年初抵澳门时，见到的第一幕就是一串中国苦力的辫子被一根根绑在一起，被像牲口一样押进苦力围栏的悲惨景象。后来在广州，我曾设法将两三个拐卖苦力者逮捕归案，并让他们戴上重达四十磅的木枷，白天黑夜都不得摘下，作为其拐卖行为的惩罚。

我将与秘鲁特使的会谈原原本本地向总督汇报。他听完后简短地说：“你回来的正是时候，我正准备给你发电报。我希望你尽快返回哈特福德，并立即准备启程前往秘鲁，调查当地中国苦力的生存状况。”

我回到哈特福德后发现，秦缆聘也收到了政府的指示，负责调查古巴华工的状况。这些相关任务是由李鸿章建议安排的。我的行程早于秦缆聘出发。我的朋友、牧师J.H.特威切尔，以及后成为我连襟的E.W.凯洛格医生陪我一同前往。我用了三个月时间完成调查，并在秦缆聘启程赴古巴前将报告写就提交。我们两人的报告最终一同送交负责外交事务的李鸿章总督。

我附在报告中的，还有二十多张华工的照片，清晰可见他们背上被鞭打撕裂的伤痕与瘢痕。这些照片是在夜间秘密拍摄的，除了受害人自己外无人知晓。他们是我亲自请来集合，以便拍照。我深知，这些照片将成为揭示种植园主非人虐待、残酷压榨华工的有力证据，无法反驳、无法否认。

当初被派往中国与李鸿章总督谈判、希望继续推进苦力输入秘鲁条约的秘鲁特使，还在天津等待我的调查报告。一位朋友写信告诉我，那名特使竟然有胆否认我报告中的指控，声称这些内容缺乏事实依据。我早已提前写信给李鸿章，请他暂时保留那些照片，等秘鲁特使的辩解耗尽之后再拿出来应对。朋友来信中说，总督果然依计而行——那些照片一经展示，证据确凿，秘鲁人震惊无言，顿时哑口无言、狼狈不堪，只得悻悻而退。

自从我们两人分别递交了关于古巴与秘鲁中国苦力真实处境的报告之后，中国政府再未允许有一名华工前往这两个国家。这条惨无人道的人口贩运链条，自此宣告终结。

第十八章
秘鲁华工调查录

1873年春，我专程返华引进加特林机枪——这种具有毁灭性威力的新式武器。虽费尽周折说服发明者加特林博士授予中国代理权，但抵津一月后即签下五十挺机枪、逾十万两白银的订单，令该公司对我刮目相看。

正当处理军火事务时，直隶总督告知秘鲁特使正在津门等候签约，欲继续引进华工。我奉命往见，该特使极力粉饰秘鲁华工"备受优待、生活富足"之景，怂恿清廷缔约鼓励贫民赴秘。我当即揭露澳门猪仔贸易黑幕：乡民如何被诱拐囚禁于巴拉坑（Barracoon，奴隶收容所），强逼签约后贩往古巴、秘鲁；抵岸时被竞价拍卖，契约期满辄被迫续约，实同终身奴役；更详述中途航线之恐怖——整船华工或跳海自尽，或杀尽船员任船漂流。

回忆1855年初抵澳门所见：成群苦力被发辫相系，如牲口般牵入巴拉坑。昔在粤省，我曾将数名拐匪枷以四十斤重木杻示众两月。秘鲁特使闻言色变，悻悻而退。返告总督时，方知朝廷已电令我速返哈特福德，筹备秘鲁华工调查事宜。

返美后发现陈兰彬亦奉查办古巴华工之命。我携牧师特韦切尔与未来连襟凯洛格医生先行，三月即成调查报告归国，较陈兰彬赴古巴更早竣事。报告附二十四帧夜间密摄的背伤照片——鞭痕交错、皮开肉绽的脊背，无声控诉着庄园主的暴行。

当那位矢口否认华工受虐的秘鲁特使在天津等待报告时，总督依我前议，待其狡辩殆尽方出示照片。铁证当前，特使瞠目结舌，颓然败退。自古巴、秘鲁华工调查报告上呈，清廷永禁苦力贩运往该两地，此虐民之弊政终得革除。

（注："巴拉坑"音译保留原文殖民色彩；"木杻"选用清代刑具术语；末段"瞠目结舌"四字格强化戏剧性场景）
