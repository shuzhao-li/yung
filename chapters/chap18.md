CHAPTER XVIII 

INVESTIGATION OF THE COOLIE 
TRAFFIC IN PERU 

In the spring of 1873, I returned to China on 
a flying visit for the sole purpose of introducing 
the Catling gun a comparatively new weapon 
of warfare of a most destructive character. I 
had some difficulty in persuading the Gatling 
Company to give me the sole agency of the gun 
in China, hecause they did not know who I was, 
and were unacquainted with my practical busi- 
ness experience. In fact, they did not know how 
successfully I had carried on the Taiping Green 
Tea Expedition in 1860-1, in the face of dangers 
and privations which few men dared to face. 
However, I prevailed on the president of the 
company, Dr. Gatling himself, the inventor of 
the gun, to entrust me with the agency. Exactly 
a month after my arrival in Tientsin, I cabled 
the company an order for a battery of fifty guns, 
which amounted altogether to something over 
$100,000, a pretty big order for a man who it 

was thought could not do anything. This order

was followed by subsequent orders. I was 
anxious that China should have the latest modern 
guns as well as the latest modern educated men. 
The Gatling Company was satisfied with my 
work and had a different opinion of me after- 
wards. 

While I was in Tientsin, attending to the gun 
business, the Viceroy told me that the Peruvian 
commissioner was there waiting to make a 
treaty with China regarding the further impor- 
tation of coolie labor into Peru. He wanted me 
to call on the commissioner and talk with him on 
the subject, which I did. In his conversation, 
he pictured to me in rosy colors how well the 
Chinese were treated in Peru; how they were 
prospering and doing well there, and said that the 
Chinese government ought to conclude a treaty 
with Peru to encourage the poorer class of 
Chinese to emigrate to that country, which 
offered a fine chance for them to better them- 
selves. I told him that I knew something about 
the coolie traffic as it was carried on in Macao; 
how the country people were inveigled and kid- 
napped, put into barracoons and kept there by 
force till they were shipped on board, where they 
were made to sign labor contracts either for 
Cuba or Peru. On landing at their destination.

they were then sold to the highest bidder, and 
made to sign another contract with their new 
masters, who took special care to have the con- 
tract renewed at the end of every term, prac- 
tically making slaves of them for life. Then I 
told him something about the horrors of the 
middle passage between Macao and Cuba or 
Peru; how whole cargoes of them revolted in 
mid-ocean, and either committed wholesale sui- 
cide by jumping into the ocean, or else over- 
powered the captain and the crew, killed them 
and threw them overboard, and then took their 
chances in the drifting of the vessel. 

Such were some of the facts and horrors of 
the coolie traffic I pictured to the Peruvian Com- 
missioner. I told him plainly that he must not 
expect me to help him in this diabolical business. > 
On the contrary, I told him I would dissuade the 
Viceroy from entering into a treaty with Peru to 
carry on such inhuman traffic. How the Peru- 
vian's countenance changed when he heard me 
deliver my mind on the subject! Disappoint- 
ment, displeasure and anger were visible in his 
countenance. I bade him good morning, for I 
was myself somewhat excited as I narrated what 
I had seen in Macao and what I had read in the 
papers about the coolie traffic. Indeed, one of

the first scenes I had seen on my arrival in Macao 
in 1855 was a string of poor Chinese coolies tied 
to each other hy their cues and led into one of the 
barracoons like abject slaves. Once, while in 
Canton, I had succeeded in having two or three 
kidnappers arrested, and had them put into 
wooden collars weighing forty pounds, which the 
culprits had to carry night and day for a couple 
of months as a punishment for their kidnapping. 

Returning to the Viceroy, I told him I had 
made the call, and narrated my interview. The 
Viceroy, to make my visit short, then said, "You 
have come back just in time to save me from 
cabling you. I wish you to return to Hartford 
as quickly as possible and make preparations to 
proceed to Peru at once, to look into the condi- 
tion of the Chinese coolies there." 

On my return to Hartford, I found that Chin 
Lan Pin had also been instructed by the gov- 
ernment to look after the condition of the 
Chinese coolies in Cuba. These collateral or side 
missions were ordered at Li Hung Chang's sug- 
gestion. I started on my mission before Chin 
Lan Pin did. My friend, the Rev. J. H. 
Twichell, and Dr. E. W. Kellogg, who after- 
wards became my brother-in-law, accompanied 
me on my trip. I finished my work inside of

three months, and had my report completed be- 
fore Chin started on his journey to Cuba. On 
his return, both of our reports were forwarded 
to Viceroy Li, who was in charge of all foreign 
diplomatic affairs. 

My report was accompanied with two dozen 
photographs of Chinese coolies, showing how 
their backs had been lacerated and torn, scarred 
and disfigured by the lash, I had these photo- 
graphs taken in the night, unknown to anyone 
except the victims themselves, who were, at my 
request, collected and assembled together for the 
purpose. I knew that these photographs would 
tell a tale of cruelty and inhumanity perpetrated 
by the owners of haciendas, which would be 
beyond cavil and dispute. 

The Peruvian Commissioner, who was sent out 
to China to negotiate a treaty with Viceroy Li 
Hung Chang to continue the coolie traffic to 
Peru, was still in Tientsin waiting for the arrival 
of my report. A friend of mine wrote me that 
he had the hardihood to deny the statements in 
my report, and said that they could not be sup- 
ported by facts. I had written to the Viceroy 
beforehand that he should hold the photographs 
in reserve, and keep them in the background till 
the Peruvian had exhausted all his arguments,

and then produce them. My correspondent wrote 
me that the Viceroy followed my suggestion, and 
the photographs proved to be so incontrovertible 
and palpable that the Peruvian was taken by 
surprise and was dumbfounded. He retired 
completely crestfallen. 

Since our reports on the actual conditions of 
Chinese coolies in Cuba and Peru were made, 
no more coolies have been allowed to leave China 
for those countries. The traffic had received its 
death blow.
