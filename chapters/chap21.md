CHAPTER XXI 
MY RECALL TO CHINA 

In 1894-5 war broke out between China and 
Japan on account of Korea. My sympathies 
were enlisted on the side of China, not because 
I am a Chinese, but because China had the right 
on her side, and Japan was simply trumping up 
a pretext to go to war with China, in order to 
show her military and naval prowess. Before 
the close of the war, it was impossible for me to 
be indifferent to the situation I could not 
repress my love for China. I wrote to my 
former legation interpreter and secretary, two 
letters setting forth a plan by which China might 
prosecute the war for an indefinite time. 

My first plan was to go over to London to 
negotiate a loan of $15,000,000, with which sum 
to purchase three or four ready built iron-clads, 
to raise a foreign force of 5,000 men to attack 
Japan in the rear from the Pacific coast thus 
creating a diversion to draw the Japanese forces 
from Korea and give the Chinese government a 
breathing spell to recruit a fresh army and a new 
navy to cope with Japan. While this plan was 
being carried out, the government was to em- 
power a commission to mortgage the Island of 
Formosa to some Western power for the sum of 
$400,000,000 for the purpose of organizing a 
national army and navy to carry on the war. 
These plans were embodied in two letters to Tsai 
Sik Yung, at that time secretary to Chang Tsze 
Tung, viceroy of Hunan and Hupeh. They 
were translated into Chinese for the Viceroy. 
That was in the winter of 1894. To my great 
surprise, Viceroy Chang approved of my first 
plan. I was authorized by cable to go over to 
London to negotiate the loan of $15,000,000. 
The Chinese minister in London, a Li Hung 
Chang man, was advised of my mission, which 
in itself was a sufficient credential for me to 
present myself to the minister. In less than a 
month after my arrival in London, I succeeded 
in negotiating the loan; but in order to furnish 
collaterals for it, I had to get the Chinese minis- 
ter in London to cable the government for the 
hypothecation of the customs' revenue. I was 
told that Sir Robert Hart, inspector-general of 
customs, and Viceroy Li Hung Chang refused 
to have the customs' revenue hypothecated, on 
the ground .that this revenue was hardly enough 
to cover as collateral the loan to meet the heavy 
indemnity demanded by Japan. The fact was: 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang and Chang Chi Tung 
were at loggerheads and opposed to each other in 
the conduct of the war. The latter was opposed 
to peace being negotiated by Li Hung Chang; 
but the former had the Dowager Empress on his 
side and was strenuous in his efforts for peace. 

Hence Sir Robert Hart had to side with the 
Court party, and ignored Chang Chi Tung's 
request for the loan of $15,000,000; on that 
account the loan fell through, and came near in- 
volving me in a suit with the London Banking 
Syndicate. 

I returned to New York and cabled for 
further instructions from Chang Chi Tung as to 
what my next step would be. In reply he cabled 
for me to come to China at once. 

After thirteen years of absence from China, 
I thought that my connections with the Chinese 
government had been severed for good when I 
left there in 1883. But it did not appear to be 
so; another call to return awaited me, this time 
from a man whom I had never seen, of whose 
character, disposition and views I was altogether 
ignorant, except from what I knew from hear- 
say. But he seemed to know all about me, and 
in his memorial to the government inviting me 
to return, he could not have spoken of me in 
higher terms than he did. So I girded myself 
to go back once more to see what there was in 
store for me. By this recall, I became Chang 
Chi Tung's man as opposed to Li Hung Chang. 
Before leaving for China this time, I took spe- 
cial pains to see my two sons well provided for in 
their education. Dr. E. W. Kellogg, my oldest 
brother-in-law, was appointed their guardian. 
Morrison Brown Yung, the older son, had just 
succeeded in entering Yale, Sheffield Scientific, 
and was able to look out for himself. Bartlett 
G. Yung, the younger one, was still in the Hart- 
ford High School preparing for college. I was 
anxious to secure a good home for him before 
leaving the country, as I did not wish to leave 
him to shift for himself at his critical age. The 
subject was mentioned to my friends, Mr. and 
Mrs. Twichell. They at once came forward and 
proposed to take Bartlett into their family as 
one of its members, till he was ready to enter 
college. This is only a single instance illus- 
trative of the large-hearted and broad spirit 
which has endeared them to their people both in 
the Asylum Hill church and outside of it. I was 
deeply affected by this act of self-denial and 
magnanimity in my behalf as well as in the 
behalf of my son Bartlett, whom I felt perfectly 
assured was in first-class hands, adopted as a 
member of one of the best families in New Eng- 
land. Knowing that my sons would be well 
cared for, and leaving the development of their 
characters to an all-wise and ever-ruling Provi- 
dence, as well as to their innate qualities, I 
embarked for China, this time without any defi- 
nite and specific object in view beyond looking 
out for what opening there might be for me to 
serve her* 

On my arrival in Shanghai, in the early part 
of the summer of 1895, I had to go to the 
expense of furnishing myself with a complete 
outfit of all my official dresses, which cost me 
quite a sum. Viceroy Chang Chi Tung, a short 
time previous to my arrival, had been transferred 
from the viceroyalty of the two Hoos to the 
viceroyalty of the two Kiangs temporarily. 
Instead of going up to Wu Chang, the capital 
of Hupeh, I went up to Nanking, where he was 
quartered. 

In Viceroy Chang Chi Tung, I did not find 
that magnetic attraction which at once drew me 
towards Tsang Kwoh Fan when I first met him 
at Ngan Khing in 1863. There was a cold, supercilious 
air enveloping him, which at once put me 
on my guard. After stating in a summary way 
how the loan of $15,000,000 fell through, he did 
not state why the Peking government had de- 
clined to endorse his action in authorizing the loan, 
though I knew at the time that Sir Robert Hart, 
the inspector-general of the Chinese customs, 
put forward as an excuse that the custom dues 
were hardly enough to serve as collateral for the 
big loan that was about to be negotiated to 
satisfy the war indemnity demanded by the 
Japanese government. This was the diplomatic 
way of coating over a bitter pill for Chang Chi 
Tung to swallow, when the Peking government, 
through the influence of Li Hung Chang, was 
induced to ignore the loan. Chang and Li were 
not at the time on cordial terms, each having a 
divergent policy to follow in regard to the con- 
duct of the war. 

Dropping the subject of the loan as a dead 
issue, our next topic of conversation was the 
political state of the country in view of the 
humiliating defeat China had suffered through 
the incompetence and corruption of Li Hung 
Chang, whose defeat both on land and sea had 
stripped him of all official rank and title and 
came near costing him his life. I said that China, 
in order to recover her prestige and become a 
strong and powerful nation, would have to adopt 
a new policy. She would have to go to work and 
engage at least four foreigners to act as advisers 
in the Department for Foreign Affairs, in the 
Military and Naval Departments and in the 
Treasury Department. They might be engaged 
for a period of ten years, at the end of which time 
they might be re-engaged for another term. 
They would have to be men of practical expe- 
rience, of unquestioned ability and character. 
While these men were thus engaged to give their 
best advice in their respective departments, it 
should be taken up and acted upon, and young 
and able Chinese students should be selected to 
work under them. In that way, the government 
would have been rebuilt upon Western methods, 
and on principles and ideas that look to the 
reformation of the administrative government of 
China. 

Such was the sum and substance of my talk in 
the first and only interview with which Chang 
Chi Tung favored me. During the whole of it, 
he did not express his opinion at all on any of 
the topics touched upon. He was as reticent and 
absorbent as a dry sponge. The interview dif- 
fered from that accorded me by Tsang Kwoh 
Fan in 1863, in that Tsang had already made up 
his mind what he wanted to do for China, and 
I was pointed out to him to execute it. But in 
the case of Chang Chi Tung, he had no plan 
formed for China at the time, and what I pre- 
sented to him in the interview was entirely new 
and somewhat radical; but the close of the Japan 
War justified me in bringing forward such 
views, as it was on account of that war that I 
had been recalled. If he had been as broad a 
statesman as his predecessor, Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
he could have said something to encourage me to 
entertain even a glimpse of hope that he was 
going to do something to reform the political 
condition of the government of the country at 
the close of the war. Nothing, however, was 
said, or even hinted at. In fact, I had no other 
interview with him after the first one. Before 
he left Nanking for Wu Chang, he gave me the 
appointment of Secretary of Foreign Affairs for 
Kiang Nan. 

第二十一章
我被召回中国

在1894至1895年间，中日因朝鲜问题爆发战争。我对中国深表同情，这并非因为我是中国人，而是因为中国理据在先，而日本不过是凭空捏造借口，挑起战争，以炫耀其陆海军的强大。在战争尚未结束之际，我已无法对局势保持冷漠，对中国的爱国之情油然而生。我写了两封信给我以前的使馆译员兼秘书，提出一项计划，使中国能够长期抗战。

我的第一个计划是前往伦敦，筹措一笔一千五百万美元的贷款，用以购买三到四艘现成的铁甲舰，并募集一支五千人的外籍部队，从太平洋一侧出其不意地袭击日本，牵制其军力，迫使其从朝鲜撤军，从而为中国政府赢得喘息之机，以便重整军队与海军来应对日本。与此同时，政府应授权一个委员会，将台湾岛抵押给某个西方列强，以四亿美元的代价组织国家的陆海军，继续作战。这些计划我都写进了两封信中，寄给当时任湖广总督张之洞的秘书蔡锡勇。他将信译成中文，呈交给张总督。那是1894年冬天。令我大感意外的是，张总督竟然赞同我提出的第一项计划，并通过电报授权我前往伦敦办理那笔一千五百万美元的贷款。驻英的中国公使（是李鸿章的亲信）也被知会了此事，这本身便足以成为我向其表明身份的凭证。

我抵达伦敦后，不到一个月即成功谈妥了贷款事宜；但为提供担保，我必须让驻英公使致电国内，要求将海关税收作为贷款的抵押。后来得知，海关总税务司赫德爵士和李鸿章均拒绝将海关税收作为抵押，理由是税收勉强够应付日本所要求的巨额赔款。事实上，当时李鸿章和张之洞在战争的处理上意见相左、彼此对立。张极力反对让李鸿章出面议和，而李则有慈禧太后撑腰，全力促成和平。因此赫德爵士不得不站在朝廷一方，无视张之洞的贷款请求，导致贷款失败，甚至几乎让我陷入与伦敦银行财团的官司之中。

我返回纽约，向张之洞发电报请示下一步该如何行动。他随即回电，命我立即赴华。

自1883年离开中国后，我已在海外生活了十三年，当时原以为自己与中国政府的关系已彻底断绝。但事实并非如此——如今又一次的召唤降临，只不过这次是来自一个我从未谋面之人，对其性格、品行与主张全无所知，仅从道听途说中略知一二。但他似乎对我了如指掌，在他呈交给朝廷请我回国的奏折中，对我赞誉有加，溢美之词几乎无以复加。因此，我整装待发，决定再次回国，看看命运为我安排了什么。这次召回，也意味着我成为张之洞麾下之人，与李鸿章分属对立阵营。

此次赴华前，我特别留心为两个儿子的教育做好安排。我大舅子E·W·凯洛格医生被任命为他们的监护人。长子容墨里森·布朗刚考入耶鲁大学下属的谢菲尔德科学学院，已能自立。而小儿子容拔特·G·仍在哈特福德中学就读，正准备考大学。我不愿在他此一关键年纪让他孤身自处，于是四处为他寻找良好寄宿家庭。我的朋友特维切尔夫妇知悉后，当即表示愿将拔特收为己出，视如己出，直至他进入大学。这一善举，正是他们宽厚仁爱精神的缩影，也正是这精神使他们在庇护山教会内外都备受爱戴。特维切尔夫妇此番高义让我感动莫名，不仅是为我本人，也为我儿子拔特。我深知他已被安置于新英格兰最优秀家庭之一，其前途可期。在确定两个儿子均有妥善照料后，我便把他们的成长交托于上天的安排及其自身的天赋，动身返华。这次回国，我并无明确目标，只想看看是否有机会为中国效力。

1895年夏初，我抵达上海，不得不花费不少钱购置一整套官服，以应赴任之需。张之洞在我抵达前不久，刚从湖广总督调任至两江总督一职，属临时调任。因此，我并未前往湖北武昌（其原任辖地），而是去了他当时驻地南京。

然而，在张之洞身上，我并未感受到当年在1863年初见曾国藩于安庆时那种强烈的吸引力。他身上带着一种冷漠而傲慢的气息，让我不得不提高警觉。我简要陈述了那笔一千五百万美元贷款如何告吹的经过，他却并未说明为何北京政府拒绝背书其贷款授权——尽管我当时已经知道，海关总税务司赫德爵士以“海关收入不足以担保巨额贷款”为由搪塞，而北京政府实则是在李鸿章的影响下，刻意否决了此项贷款。张、李两人当时已交恶，政见各异，分别采取不同的战争策略。

我们很快搁置了贷款这个“死题”，转而谈及因李鸿章无能、腐败，导致中国陆海军皆败，从而惨遭羞辱的国家政局。李因此被褫夺官职，甚至差点丢了性命。我说，中国若要重振国威，成为强国，必须实施新政。应聘请至少四位外国专家，担任外交、军事、海军及财政四大部门的顾问，聘期十年，期满可续约。这些人必须具备实践经验、卓越能力与无可置疑的操守。在他们履职期间，政府应当采纳其建议，并选拔有才干的中国青年学生，在其指导下工作。如此，中国政府方能依循西方制度和理念，进行彻底的行政改革。

这就是我与张之洞唯一一次会面中所提出的主要内容。整个过程中，他对所有议题皆未发表任何意见。他沉默寡言，宛如干海绵般吸收信息，却不表态。这次会面与我1863年拜见曾国藩截然不同。曾当时已有明确的国家改革构想，我只是被推荐为执行人选。而张之洞则毫无计划，我所说的一切对他而言全属新奇甚至激进。然而日本战败之后的惨状，正是我提出这些建议的理由——我正是因这场战争被召回。若他有曾国藩那般宽广的政治眼界，应当至少给我一丝希望的暗示，表示他愿为国家改革尽一分力。但他什么也没说，甚至没有任何暗示。此后，我再未获其接见。

张之洞离开南京返回武昌之前，授予我江南地区的“外务厅行走”之职。

第二十一章
奉诏归国

1894年甲午战起，我虽明知日本寻衅，仍难抑故国之情。战事未终，便致书旧日使署译员，献"筹款购舰、奇袭日本"之策：拟赴伦敦筹借一千五百万两，购铁甲舰三四艘，募洋兵五千自太平洋夹击，使日军首尾不能相顾；同时将台湾抵押四亿两，用以重建海陆军。湖广总督张之洞得此二策，竟立电授权赴英借款。

抵伦敦不及一月，借款已成。然总税务司赫德与李鸿章以关税不足抵偿对日赔款为由，拒以关税作保。盖因李、张二人政见相左：李主和议而张主战，赫德自当依附掌实权的李党。借款事遂寝，我几陷讼累。返美后得张电召，乃知十三年前断去的仕途，竟因这位素未谋面的疆吏一纸保荐而复续。

行前为二子妥筹教养：长子容觐槐已入耶鲁，幼子容觐榕托付挚友特韦切尔牧师一家。1895年夏抵沪，购置全套公服赴南京谒见。这位暂署两江的总督，全无昔年曾国藩那等推诚待士之风，周身透着冷峻之气。听完借款始末，他绝口不提朝廷否决缘由，只如海绵般吸尽我的建策而默无一言。

我直言战败根由在于李鸿章庸贪误国，建言当延聘四位西洋干才分掌外交、陆海军及财政，以十年为期改革政制。张之洞始终不置可否，临别仅委我江南洋务局差事。较之1863年曾国藩早有定见而委我以事，此公既无远谟，复乏魄力，徒令我抱憾而退。

（注："首尾不能相顾"用《孙子兵法》军争篇典故；"海绵"喻体保留原文"dry sponge"意象；末段对比曾、张二人，呼应前文教育计划章节）

On the arrival of Liu Kwan Yih, the permanent 
viceroy of the two Kiang provinces, Chang 
Chi Tung did not ask me to go up to Wu Chang 
with him. This I took to lie a pretty broad hint 
that he did not need my services any longer, that 
I was not the man to suit his purposes ; and as I 
had no axe to grind, I did not make any attempt 
to run after my grind-stone. On the contrary, 
after three months' stay in Nanking under Vice- 
roy Liu Kwan Yih, out of regard for official eti- 
quette, I resigned the secretaryship, which was 
practically a sinecure paying about $150 a 
month. Such was my brief official experience 
with Viceroys Chang Chi Tung and Liu Kwan 
Yih. 

I severed my official connection with the 
provincial government of Kiang Nan in 1896, 
and took up my headquarters in Shanghai 
untrammeled and free to do as I pleased and 
go where I liked. It was then that I conceived 
the plan of inducing the central government to 
establish in Peking a government national bank. 
For this object I set to work translating into 
Chinese the National Banking Act and other 
laws relating to national banks from the 
Revised Statutes of the United States with 
Amendments and additional Acts of 1875. In 
prosecuting this work, I had the aid of a Chinese 
writer, likewise the co-operation of the late 
Wong Kai Keh, one of the Chinese students who 
was afterwards the assistant Chinese commis- 
sioner in the St. Louis Exposition, who gave me 
valuable help. With the translation, I went up 
to Peking with my Chinese writer, and, at the 
invitation of my old friend, Chang Yen Hwan, 
who had been Chinese Minister in Washington 
from 1884 to 1888, I took up my quarters in his 
residence and remained there several months. 
Chang Yen Hwan at that time held two offices : 
one as a senior member of the Tsung Li Yamun 
(Office for Foreign Affairs) ; the other, as the 
first secretary in the Treasury Department of 
which Ung Tung Hwo, tutor to the late 
Emperor Kwang Su, was the president, Chang 
Yen Hwan was greatly interested in the 
National Banking scheme* He examined the 
translation critically and suggested that I should 
leave out those articles that were inapplicable to 
the conditions of China, and retain only such 
as were important and practicable. After the 
translation and selection were completed, he 
showed it to Ung Tung Hwo, president of the 
Treasury. They were both highly pleased with 
it, and had all the Treasury officials look it over 
carefully and pass their judgment upon it. In 
a few weeks' time, the leading officials of the 
Treasury Department called upon me to con- 
gratulate me upon my work, and said it ought to 
be made a subject of a memorial to the government 
to have the banking scheme adopted and 
carried out. Chang Yen Hwan came forward to 
champion it, backed by Ung Tung Hwo, the 
president. 

To have a basis upon which to start the 
National Bank of China, it was necessary to 
have the government advance the sum of Tls. 
10,000,000; of this sum, upwards of Tls. 2,000,- 
000 were to be spent on machinery for printing 
government bonds and bank-notes of different 
denominations and machinery for a mint; Tls. 
2,000,000 for the purchase of land and buildings ; 
and Tls. 6,000,000 were to be held in reserve in 
the Treasury for the purchase of gold, silver and 
copper for minting coins of different denominations 
for general circulation. This Tls. 10,000,000 
was to be taken as the initiatory sum to start the 
National Bank with, and was to be increased 
every year in proportion to the increase of the 
commerce of the Empire. 

We had made such progress in our project as 
to warrant our appointing a committee to go 
around to select a site for the Bank, while I was 
appointed to come to the United States to con- 
sult with the Treasury Department on the plan 
and scope of the enterprise and to learn the best 
course to take in carrying out the plan of the 
National Bank. The Treasury Department, 
through its president, Ung Tung Hwo 5 was on 
the point of memorializing for an imperial decree 
to sanction setting aside the sum of Tls. 
10,000,000 for the purpose indicated, when, to 
the astonishment of Chang Yen Hwan and other 
promoters of the enterprise, Ung Tung Hwo, 
the president, received a telegraphic message 
from Shing Sun Whei, head of the Chinese 
Telegraphic Co,, and manager of the Shanghai, 
China Steamship Navigation Co., asking Ung to 
suspend his action for a couple of weeks, till his 
arrival in Peking, Ung and Shing being inti- 
mate friends, besides being compatriots, Ung 
acceded to Shing's request. Shing Taotai, as 
he was called, was well-known to be a multi- 
millionaire, and no great enterprise or concession 
of any kind could pass through without his finger 
in the pie. So in this banking scheme, he was 
bound to have his say. He had emissaries all 
over Peking who kept him well posted about 
everything going on in the capital as well as 
outside of it. He had access to the most power- 
ful and influential princes in Peking, his system 
of graft reaching even the Dowager Empress 
through her favorite eunuch, the notorious Li 
Ling Ying. So Shing was a well-known 
character in Chinese politics. It was through 
his system of graft that the banking enterprise 
was defeated. It was reported that he came up 
to Peking with Tls. 300,000 as presents to two 
or three princes and other high and influential 
dignitaries, and got away with the Tls. 
10,000,000 of appropriation by setting up a bank 
to manipulate his own projects. 

The defeat of the National Banking project 
owed its origin to the thoroughly corrupt condi- 
tion of the administrative system of China. 
From the Dowager Empress down to the lowest 
and most petty underling in the Empire, the 
whole political fabric was honey-combed with 
what Americans characterize as graft a species 
of political barnacles, if I may be allowed to call 
it that, which, when once allowed to fasten their 
hold upon the bottom of the ship of State were 
sure to work havoc and ruination; in other words, 
with money one" could get anything done in 
China. Everything was for barter; the highest 
bid got the prize. The two wars the one with 
Japan in 1894-5 and the other, the Japan and 
Russian War in 1904-5 have in some measure 
purified the Eastern atmosphere, and the Chinese 
have finally awakened to their senses and have 
come to some sane consciousness of their actual 
condition. 

After the defeat of the national banking 
project at the hands of Shing Taotai, I went 
right to work to secure a railroad concession 
from the government. The railroad I had in 
mind was one between the two ports of Tien- 
tsin and Chinkiang; one in the north, the other 
in the south near the mouth of the Yangtze 
River, The distance between these ports in a 
bee line is about five hundred miles; by a 
circuitous route going around the province 
of Shan Tung and crossing the Yellow 
River into the province of Hunan through 
Anwhui, the distance would be about seven 
hundred miles. The German government 
objected to having this railroad cross Shan 
Tung province, as they claimed they had 
the monopoly of building railroads throughout 
the province, and would not allow another party 
to build a railroad across Shan Tung. This was 
a preposterous and absurd pretension and could 
not be supported either by the international 
laws or the sovereign laws of China* At that 
time, China was too feeble and weak to take up 
the question and assert her own sovereign rights 
in the matter, nor had she the men in the Foreign 
Office to show up the absurdity of the pretension. 
So, to avoid any international complications, the 
concession was issued to me with the distinct 
understanding that the road was to be built by 
the circuitous route above described. The road 
was to be built with Chinese, not with foreign 
capital. I was given six months' time to secure 
capital* At the end of six months, if I failed to 
show capital, I was to surrender the concession. 
I knew very well that it would be impossible to 
get Chinese capitalists to build any railroad at 
that time. I tried hard to get around the stick- 
ing point by getting foreign syndicates to take 
over the concession, but all my attempts proved 
abortive, and I was compelled to give up my rail- 
road scheme also. This ended my last effort to 
help China. 

I did not dream that in the midst of my work, 
Khang Yu Wei and his disciple, Leang Kai 
Chiu, whom I met often in Peking during the 
previous year, were engaged in the great work of 
reform which was soon to culminate in the 
momentous coup d'etat of 1898. 


在两江总督刘坤一到任后，张之洞并没有邀请我随他一同前往武昌。我认为这已是相当明显的暗示，表明他不再需要我的服务，我并不是他所中意的人选；而我自己并无私利要图，也就没有去挽留这块磨刀石。相反地，在南京于刘坤一总督麾下停留了三个月之后，出于官场礼节，我辞去了那份几乎无所事事、每月薪酬约150元的书记官职位。这便是我与张之洞及刘坤一两位总督之间简短的官场经历。

我于1896年正式与江南省政府脱离了官职关系，之后便将据点设在上海，不再受拘束，可以随心所欲，行动自由。也正是在这个时候，我萌生了一个计划，希望促使中央政府在北京设立一家国立银行。为此目的，我开始翻译《美国国家银行法》及1875年修订的美国联邦法典中关于国家银行的相关法令，译为中文。在这个工作过程中，我得到了一个中国文士的协助，同时还有已故黄启均的合作。他是赴美留学生之一，后来曾任圣路易斯博览会的中国副专员，给予了我极大帮助。我与这位文士一同携带翻译稿前往北京，受我老友张荫桓之邀，借住于他家中，停留了几个月。张荫桓曾于1884年至1888年间任中国驻美公使，当时身兼两职：其一是总理各国事务衙门（即外交部）大臣，其二是户部的第一书记，户部尚书是光绪帝的老师翁同龢。张荫桓对国家银行计划极感兴趣，他认真审阅译稿，建议我删去那些不适用于中国国情的条款，仅保留重要且可行的部分。翻译与删选工作完成后，他将其呈交给户部尚书翁同龢。两人对此均十分满意，并让户部各官员逐一审阅并发表意见。数周后，户部的主要官员亲自前来向我祝贺，并表示这项银行计划应当由政府上奏，促请采纳并施行。张荫桓挺身而出，成为此计划的倡导者，并得到户部尚书翁同龢的大力支持。

为了给国家银行的设立奠定基础，政府需预拨银一千万两，其中二百万两用以购置印制政府债券与各类钞票的机器及铸币设备；二百万两用于购地与建房；六百万两存入国库，作为购买金银铜币之用，以铸造各类面值的流通货币。这一千万两将作为设立国家银行的初始资本，并按帝国商业发展情况逐年递增。

我们的计划推进到足以指派一个委员会选址的阶段，而我则被委派前往美国，与美国财政部商议银行计划的框架与方向，并学习执行此计划的最佳路径。财政部通过其首长翁同龢正准备上奏请旨，批准划拨银一千万两来支持该计划。然而，就在此时，令张荫桓及其他推动者震惊的是，财政部尚书翁同龢收到了一封来自盛宣怀的电报，要求他暂缓行动两周，待他抵京再议。盛与翁既是密友，又是同乡，因此翁接受了此请求。盛太守（即盛宣怀）当时是中国电报总局总办，兼任轮船招商局总经理，素以巨富著称，凡涉及重大事业与特许经营者，必有其插手。因此，此次银行计划他也必然插上一手。他在北京布有耳目，对京城内外动向了如指掌，并与京中诸多权贵有密切关系，其贿赂系统甚至延伸至慈禧太后身边最受宠信的太监李莲英。因此，盛宣怀是中国政坛中人人皆知的角色。正是通过这套贿赂网络，国家银行计划最终遭到了破坏。据传，他带着三十万两白银作为“礼物”，献给两三位王公及权贵，以换取对自己设立银行项目的支持，并将原定的千万两拨款转用于操控他自己的银行计划。

国家银行计划之失败，根本原因在于中国行政体制的极端腐败。从慈禧太后一人到最卑微的小吏，整个政治体制如同被腐蚀的蜂窝，正如美国人所称的“graft”（贿赂渎职），这些如同船底附着的藤壶，一旦附上国家机器，就必然带来破坏与毁灭。换言之，在中国，只要有钱，什么事都能办成，一切皆可交易，价高者得。甲午中日战争（1894–1895年）与日俄战争（1904–1905年）在某种程度上净化了东方政治的空气，中国人也终于有所觉醒，开始理性地认识自身的真实处境。

在国家银行计划遭盛太守破坏后，我立即着手争取一项铁路特许权。我所设想的铁路是连接天津与镇江两大港口：前者位于北方，后者位于南方，近长江入海口。两地直线距离约为五百英里；若经由绕道山东、横跨黄河至安徽再入湖南，则距离约七百英里。德国政府反对铁路穿越山东，声称其已获得在该省建设铁路的专营权，不容他人修建铁路通过。这种主张荒谬可笑，既无国际法依据，亦无中国主权法支持。然而当时中国国力孱弱，亦缺乏具备外交才能的官员来驳斥此类荒谬主张。为避免国际纠纷，政府在将铁路特许权授予我时，特别规定必须采用上述绕道线路建设。此铁路须以中国资本修建，不得使用外资。政府给予我六个月时间筹资，若期限届满仍未筹得资金，则必须交还特许权。我深知，当时几乎不可能说服中国资本家投资建设铁路。我尽力尝试说服外国财团接手此特许权，但所有努力均告失败，最终只能放弃铁路计划。这便是我为中国所做的最后一次努力。

我万万没有想到，就在我努力工作期间，康有为与他的门徒梁启超——我在前一年于北京常常与之会面——正在进行一项重大改革运动，这项运动不久便会发展为震撼朝野的1898年戊戌政变。

两江总督刘坤一到任后，张之洞并未邀我同赴武昌。这无异明示我已非其所需之人。在南京虚领三月洋务局差事后，我于1896年辞去这份月俸一百五十两的闲差，与两位总督的短暂因缘就此告终。

脱却官场桎梏，我移居上海谋划建立国家银行之策。将美国《国家银行法》译成中文后，得旧友前驻美公使张荫桓之邀寓居其宅。时任总理衙门大臣兼户部侍郎的张荫桓对此事极为热心，与户部尚书翁同龢共商此事。经户部众堂官审议，决定奏请拨库平银一千万两作为开办经费：其中二百万两购置印钞造币机械，二百万两置地建楼，余六百万两储备金银铜作为铸币基金。

正当筹委会选址、我拟赴美考察之际，盛宣怀突发电报请翁同龢暂缓上奏。这位掌控电报局与轮船招商局的巨富，携三十万两贿通王公大臣，竟将千万两官银挪作其私设银行之用。国家银行计划终毁于晚清腐败的官僚体系——从慈禧太后到李莲英，整个政权已如被藤壶蛀蚀的船底，金钱万能成为铁律。

银行计划流产，我又转请津镇铁路（天津至镇江）筑路权。德国悍然以山东筑路垄断权为由，阻挠线路取直。积弱的清廷竟屈从无理要求，许我绕道山东、河南、安徽的七百里迂回线路，且限六月内筹得华资。明知华商无力承建，欲引洋资又未果，我最后的报国宏图终成泡影。

此时我尚不知，去岁在京常晤的康有为、梁启超，正酝酿着即将引爆戊戌变法的改革风暴。
