CHAPTER XXI 
MY RECALL TO CHINA 

In 1894-5 war broke out between China and 
Japan on account of Korea. My sympathies 
were enlisted on the side of China, not because 
I am a Chinese, but because China had the right 
on her side, and Japan was simply trumping up 
a pretext to go to war with China, in order to 
show her military and naval prowess. Before 
the close of the war, it was impossible for me to 
be indifferent to the situation I could not 
repress my love for China. I wrote to my 
former legation interpreter and secretary, two 
letters setting forth a plan by which China might 
prosecute the war for an indefinite time. 

My first plan was to go over to London to 
negotiate a loan of $15,000,000, with which sum 
to purchase three or four ready built iron-clads, 
to raise a foreign force of 5,000 men to attack 
Japan in the rear from the Pacific coast thus 
creating a diversion to draw the Japanese forces 
from Korea and give the Chinese government a 
breathing spell to recruit a fresh army and a new 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 225 

navy to cope with Japan. While this plan was 
being carried out, the government was to em- 
power a commission to mortgage the Island of 
Formosa to some Western power for the sum of 
$400,000,000 for the purpose of organizing a 
national army and navy to carry on the war. 
These plans were embodied in two letters to Tsai 
Sik Yung, at that time secretary to Chang Tsze 
Tung, viceroy of Hunan and Hupeh. They 
were translated into Chinese for the Viceroy. 
That was in the winter of 1894. To my great 
surprise, Viceroy Chang approved of my first 
plan. I was authorized by cable to go over to 
London to negotiate the loan of $15,000,000. 
The Chinese minister in London, a Li Hung 
Chang man, was advised of my mission, which 
in itself was a sufficient credential for me to 
present myself to the minister. In less than a 
month after my arrival in London, I succeeded 
in negotiating the loan; but in order to furnish 
collaterals for it, I had to get the Chinese minis- 
ter in London to cable the government for the 
hypothecation of the customs' revenue. I was 
told that Sir Robert Hart, inspector-general of 
customs, and Viceroy Li Hung Chang refused 
to have the customs' revenue hypothecated, on 
the ground .that this revenue was hardly enough 



226 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

to cover as collateral the loan to meet the heavy 
indemnity demanded by Japan. The fact was: 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang and Chang Chi Tung 
were at loggerheads and opposed to each other in 
the conduct of the war. The latter was opposed 
to peace being negotiated by Li Hung Chang; 
but the former had the Dowager Empress on his 
side and was strenuous in his efforts for peace. 

Hence Sir Robert Hart had to side with the 
Court party, and ignored Chang Chi Tung's 
request for the loan of $15,000,000; on that 
account the loan fell through, and came near in- 
volving me in a suit with the London Banking 
Syndicate. 

I returned to New York and cabled for 
further instructions from Chang Chi Tung as to 
what my next step would be. In reply he cabled 
for me to come to China at once. 

After thirteen years of absence from China, 
I thought that my connections with the Chinese 
government had been severed for good when I 
left there in 1883. But it did not appear to be 
so; another call to return awaited me, this time 
from a man whom I had never seen, of whose 
character, disposition and views I was altogether 
ignorant, except from what I knew from hear- 
say. But he seemed to know all about me, and 



MY KECALL TO CHINA 237 

in his memorial to the government inviting me 
to return, he could not have spoken of me in 
higher terms than he did. So I girded myself 
to go back once more to see what there was in 
store for me. By this recall, I became Chang 
Chi Tung's man as opposed to Li Hung Chang. 
Before leaving for China this time, I took spe- 
cial pains to see my two sons well provided for in 
their education. Dr. E. W. Kellogg, my oldest 
brother-in-law, was appointed their guardian. 
Morrison Brown Yung, the older son, had just 
succeeded in entering Yale, Sheffield Scientific, 
and was able to look out for himself. Bartlett 
G. Yung, the younger one, was still in the Hart- 
ford High School preparing for college. I was 
anxious to secure a good home for him before 
leaving the country, as I did not wish to leave 
him to shift for himself at his critical age. The 
subject was mentioned to my friends, Mr. and 
Mrs. Twichell. They at once came forward and 
proposed to take Bartlett into their family as 
one of its members, till he was ready to enter 
college. This is only a single instance illus- 
trative of the large-hearted and broad spirit 
which has endeared them to their people both in 
the Asylum Hill church and outside of it. I was 
deeply affected by this act of self-denial and 



228 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

magnanimity in my behalf as well as in the 
behalf of my son Bartlett, whom I felt perfectly 
assured was in first-class hands, adopted as a 
member of one of the best families in New Eng- 
land. Knowing that my sons would be well 
cared for, and leaving the development of their 
characters to an all-wise and ever-ruling Provi- 
dence, as well as to their innate qualities, I 
embarked for China, this time without any defi- 
nite and specific object in view beyond looking 
out for what opening there might be for me to 
serve her* 

On my arrival in Shanghai, in the early part 
of the summer of 1895, I had to go to the 
expense of furnishing myself with a complete 
outfit of all my official dresses, which cost me 
quite a sum. Viceroy Chang Chi Tung, a short 
time previous to my arrival, had been transferred 
from the viceroyalty of the two Hoos to the 
viceroyalty of the two Kiangs temporarily. 
Instead of going up to Wu Chang, the capital 
of Hupeh, I went up to Nanking, where he was 
quartered. 

In Viceroy Chang Chi Tung, I did not find 
that magnetic attraction which at once drew me 
towards Tsang Kwoh Fan when I first met him 
at Ngan Khing in 1863. There was a cold, super- 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 229 

cilious air enveloping him, which at once put me 
on my guard. After stating in a summary way 
how the loan of $15,000,000 fell through, he did 
not state why the Peking government had de- 
clined to endorse his action in authorizing the loan, 
though I knew at the time that Sir Robert Hart, 
the inspector-general of the Chinese customs, 
put forward as an excuse that the custom dues 
were hardly enough to serve as collateral for the 
big loan that was about to be negotiated to 
satisfy the war indemnity demanded by the 
Japanese government. This was the diplomatic 
way of coating over a bitter pill for Chang Chi 
Tung to swallow, when the Peking government, 
through the influence of Li Hung Chang, was 
induced to ignore the loan. Chang and Li were 
not at the time on cordial terms, each having a 
divergent policy to follow in regard to the con- 
duct of the war. 

Dropping the subject of the loan as a dead 
issue, our next topic of conversation was the 
political state of the country in view of the 
humiliating defeat China had suffered through 
the incompetence and corruption of Li Hung 
Chang, whose defeat both on land and sea had 
stripped him of all official rank and title and 
came near costing him his life. I said that China, 



230 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

in order to recover her prestige and become a 
strong and powerful nation, would have to adopt 
a new policy. She would have to go to work and 
engage at least four foreigners to act as advisers 
in the Department for Foreign Affairs, in the 
Military and Naval Departments and in the 
Treasury Department. They might be engaged 
for a period of ten years, at the end of which time 
they might be re-engaged for another term. 
They would have to be men of practical expe- 
rience, of unquestioned ability and character. 
While these men were thus engaged to give their 
best advice in their respective departments, it 
should be taken up and acted upon, and young 
and able Chinese students should be selected to 
work under them. In that way, the government 
would have been rebuilt upon Western methods, 
and on principles and ideas that look to the 
reformation of the administrative government of 
China. 

Such was the sum and substance of my talk in 
the first and only interview with which Chang 
Chi Tung favored me. During the whole of it, 
he did not express his opinion at all on any of 
the topics touched upon. He was as reticent and 
absorbent as a dry sponge. The interview dif- 
fered from that accorded me by Tsang Kwoh 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 231 

Fan in 1863, in that Tsang had already made up 
his mind what he wanted to do for China, and 
I was pointed out to him to execute it. But in 
the case of Chang Chi Tung, he had no plan 
formed for China at the time, and what I pre- 
sented to him in the interview was entirely new 
and somewhat radical; but the close of the Japan 
War justified me in bringing forward such 
views, as it was on account of that war that I 
had been recalled. If he had been as broad a 
statesman as his predecessor, Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
he could have said something to encourage me to 
entertain even a glimpse of hope that he was 
going to do something to reform the political 
condition of the government of the country at 
the close of the war. Nothing, however, was 
said, or even hinted at. In fact, I had no other 
interview with him after the first one. Before 
he left Nanking for Wu Chang, he gave me the 
appointment of Secretary of Foreign Affairs for 
Kiang Nan. 

On the arrival of Liu Kwan Yih, the perma- 
nent viceroy of the two Kiang provinces, Chang 
Chi Tung did not ask me to go up to Wu Chang 
with him. This I took to lie a pretty broad hint 
that he did not need my services any longer, that 
I was not the man to suit his purposes ; and as I 



232 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

had no axe to grind, I did not make any attempt 
to run after my grind-stone. On the contrary, 
after three months' stay in Nanking under Vice- 
roy Liu Kwan Yih, out of regard for official eti- 
quette, I resigned the secretaryship, which was 
practically a sinecure paying about $150 a 
month. Such was my brief official experience 
with Viceroys Chang Chi Tung and Liu Kwan 
Yih. 

I severed my official connection with the 
provincial government of Kiang Nan in 1896, 
and took up my headquarters in Shanghai 
untrammeled and free to do as I pleased and 
go where I liked. It was then that I conceived 
the plan of inducing the central government to 
establish in Peking a government national bank. 
For this object I set to work translating into 
Chinese the National Banking Act and other 
laws relating to national banks from the 
Revised Statutes of the United States with 
Amendments and additional Acts of 1875. In 
prosecuting this work, I had the aid of a Chinese 
writer, likewise the co-operation of the late 
Wong Kai Keh, one of the Chinese students who 
was afterwards the assistant Chinese commis- 
sioner in the St. Louis Exposition, who gave me 
valuable help. With the translation, I went up 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 233 

to Peking with my Chinese writer, and, at the 
invitation of my old friend, Chang Yen Hwan, 
who had been Chinese Minister in Washington 
from 1884 to 1888, I took up my quarters in his 
residence and remained there several months. 
Chang Yen Hwan at that time held two offices : 
one as a senior member of the Tsung Li Yamun 
(Office for Foreign Affairs) ; the other, as the 
first secretary in the Treasury Department of 
which Ung Tung Hwo, tutor to the late 
Emperor Kwang Su, was the president, Chang 
Yen Hwan was greatly interested in the 
National Banking scheme* He examined the 
translation critically and suggested that I should 
leave out those articles that were inapplicable to 
the conditions of China, and retain only such 
as were important and practicable. After the 
translation and selection were completed, he 
showed it to Ung Tung Hwo, president of the 
Treasury. They were both highly pleased with 
it, and had all the Treasury officials look it over 
carefully and pass their judgment upon it. In 
a few weeks' time, the leading officials of the 
Treasury Department called upon me to con- 
gratulate me upon my work, and said it ought to 
be made a subject of a memorial to the govern- 
ment to have the banking scheme adopted and 



84 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

carried out. Chang Yen Hwan came forward to 
champion it, backed by Ung Tung Hwo, the 
president. 

To have a basis upon which to start the 
National Bank of China, it was necessary to 
have the government advance the sum of Tls. 
10,000,000; of this sum, upwards of Tls. 2,000,- 
000 were to be spent on machinery for printing 
government bonds and bank-notes of different 
denominations and machinery for a mint; Tls. 
2,000,000 for the purchase of land and buildings ; 
and Tls. 6,000,000 were to be held in reserve in 
the Treasury for the purchase of gold, silver and 
copper for minting coins of different denomina- 
tions for general circulation. This Tls. 10,000,000 
was to be taken as the initiatory sum to start the 
National Bank with, and was to be increased 
every year in proportion to the increase of the 
commerce of the Empire. 

We had made such progress in our project as 
to warrant our appointing a committee to go 
around to select a site for the Bank, while I was 
appointed to come to the United States to con- 
sult with the Treasury Department on the plan 
and scope of the enterprise and to learn the best 
course to take in carrying out the plan of the 
National Bank. The Treasury Department, 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 235 

through its president, Ung Tung Hwo 5 was on 
the point of memorializing for an imperial decree 
to sanction setting aside the sum of Tls. 
10,000,000 for the purpose indicated, when, to 
the astonishment of Chang Yen Hwan and other 
promoters of the enterprise, Ung Tung Hwo, 
the president, received a telegraphic message 
from Shing Sun Whei, head of the Chinese 
Telegraphic Co,, and manager of the Shanghai, 
China Steamship Navigation Co., asking Ung to 
suspend his action for a couple of weeks, till his 
arrival in Peking, Ung and Shing being inti- 
mate friends, besides being compatriots, Ung 
acceded to Shing's request. Shing Taotai, as 
he was called, was well-known to be a multi- 
millionaire, and no great enterprise or concession 
of any kind could pass through without his finger 
in the pie. So in this banking scheme, he was 
bound to have his say. He had emissaries all 
over Peking who kept him well posted about 
everything going on in the capital as well as 
outside of it. He had access to the most power- 
ful and influential princes in Peking, his system 
of graft reaching even the Dowager Empress 
through her favorite eunuch, the notorious Li 
Ling Ying. So Shing was a well-known 
character in Chinese politics. It was through 



236 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

his system of graft that the banking enterprise 
was defeated. It was reported that he came up 
to Peking with Tls. 300,000 as presents to two 
or three princes and other high and influential 
dignitaries, and got away with the Tls. 
10,000,000 of appropriation by setting up a bank 
to manipulate his own projects. 

The defeat of the National Banking project 
owed its origin to the thoroughly corrupt condi- 
tion of the administrative system of China. 
From the Dowager Empress down to the lowest 
and most petty underling in the Empire, the 
whole political fabric was honey-combed with 
what Americans characterize as graft a species 
of political barnacles, if I may be allowed to call 
it that, which, when once allowed to fasten their 
hold upon the bottom of the ship of State were 
sure to work havoc and ruination; in other words, 
with money one" could get anything done in 
China. Everything was for barter; the highest 
bid got the prize. The two wars the one with 
Japan in 1894-5 and the other, the Japan and 
Russian War in 1904-5 have in some measure 
purified the Eastern atmosphere, and the Chinese 
have finally awakened to their senses and have 
come to some sane consciousness of their actual 
condition. 



MY RECALL TO CHINA 237 

After the defeat of the national banking 
project at the hands of Shing Taotai, I went 
right to work to secure a railroad concession 
from the government. The railroad I had in 
mind was one between the two ports of Tien- 
tsin and Chinkiang; one in the north, the other 
in the south near the mouth of the Yangtze 
River, The distance between these ports in a 
bee line is about five hundred miles; by a 
circuitous route going around the province 
of Shan Tung and crossing the Yellow 
River into the province of Hunan through 
Anwhui, the distance would be about seven 
hundred miles. The German government 
objected to having this railroad cross Shan 
Tung province, as they claimed they had 
the monopoly of building railroads throughout 
the province, and would not allow another party 
to build a railroad across Shan Tung. This was 
a preposterous and absurd pretension and could 
not be supported either by the international 
laws or the sovereign laws of China* At that 
time, China was too feeble and weak to take up 
the question and assert her own sovereign rights 
in the matter, nor had she the men in the Foreign 
Office to show up the absurdity of the pretension. 
So, to avoid any international complications, the 



238 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

concession was issued to me with the distinct 
understanding that the road was to be built by 
the circuitous route above described. The road 
was to be built with Chinese, not with foreign 
capital. I was given six months' time to secure 
capital* At the end of six months, if I failed to 
show capital, I was to surrender the concession. 
I knew very well that it would be impossible to 
get Chinese capitalists to build any railroad at 
that time. I tried hard to get around the stick- 
ing point by getting foreign syndicates to take 
over the concession, but all my attempts proved 
abortive, and I was compelled to give up my rail- 
road scheme also. This ended my last effort to 
help China. 

I did not dream that in the midst of my work, 
Khang Yu Wei and his disciple, Leang Kai 
Chiu, whom I met often in Peking during the 
previous year, were engaged in the great work of 
reform which was soon to culminate in the 
momentous coup d'etat of 1898.
