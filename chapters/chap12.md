CHAPTER XII 

EXPEDITION TO THE TAIPING TEA 
DISTRICT 

My Nanking visit was utterly barren of any 
substantial hope of promoting any scheme of 
educational or political reform for the general 
welfare of China or for the advancement of my 
personal interest. When I was thoroughly con- 
vinced that neither the reformation nor the 
regeneration of China was to come from the Tai- 
pings, I at once turned my thoughts to the idea 
of making a big fortune as my first duty, and 
as the first element in the successful carrying out 
of other plans for the future. 

One day, while sauntering about in the tea 
garden inside the city of Shanghai, I came across 
a few tea-merchants regaling themselves with 
that beverage in a booth by themselves, evidently 
having a very social time. They beckoned to me 
to join their party. In the course of the conver- 
sation, we happened to touch on my late journey 
through the tea districts of Hunan, Hupeh and 
Kiang Si and also my trip to Nanking. Passing 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

from one topic of conversation to another, we 
lighted upon the subject of the green tea district 
of Taiping in An Hwui province. It was stated 
that an immense quantity of green tea could be 
found there, all packed and boxed ready for 
shipment, and that the rebels were in possession 
of the goods, and that whoever had the hardihood 
and courage to risk his life to gain possession of 
it would become a millionaire. I listened to the 
account with deep and absorbing interest, taking 
in everything that was said on the subject. It 
was stated that there were over 1,000,000 chests 
of tea there. Finally the party broke up, and 
I wended my way to my quarters completely 
absorbed in deep thought. I reasoned with 
myself that this was a chance for me to make a 
fortune, but wondered who would be foolhardy 
enough to furnish the capital, thinking that no 
business man of practical experience would risk 
his money in such a wild goose adventure, sur- 
rounded as it was with more than ordinary 
dangers and difficulties, in a country where 
highway robbery, lawlessness and murder were 
of daily occurrence. But with the glamor of a 
big fortune confronting me, all privations, 
dangers and risks of life seemed small and faded 
into airy nothing. 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 125 

My friend, Tsang Mew, who had been instru- 
mental in having me sent traveling into the 
interior a year before, was a man of great 
business experience. He had a long head and a 
large circle of business acquaintances, besides 
being my warm friend, so I concluded to go to 
him and talk over the whole matter, as I knew 
he would not hesitate to give me his best advice. 
I laid the whole subject before him. He said he 
would consider the matter fully and in a few 
days let me know what he had decided to do 
about it. After a few days, he told me that he 
had had several consultations with the head of 
the firm, of which he was comprador, and be- 
tween them the company had decided to take up 
my project. 

The plan of operation as mapped out by me 
was as follows: I was to go to the district of 
Taiping by the shortest and safest route possible, 
to find out whether the quantity of tea did exist; 
whether it was safe to have treasure taken up 
there to pay the rebels for the tea; and whether 
it was possible to have the tea supply taken down 
by native boats to be transhipped by steamer to 
Shanghai. This might be called the preliminary 
expedition. Then, I was to determine which of 
the two routes would be the more feasible, 



126 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

there being two, one by way of Wuhu, a treaty 
port, and another by way of Ta Tung, not a 
treaty port, a hundred miles above Wuhu. 
Wuhu and the whole country leading to 
Taiping, including the district itself, was under 
the jurisdiction of the rebels, whereas Ta Tung 
was still in possession of the imperialists. From 
Wuhu to Taiping by river the distance was 
about two hundred and fifty miles, whereas, by 
way of Ta Tung, the way, though shorter, 
was mostly overland, which made transportation 
more difficult and expensive, besides having to 
pay the imperialists a heavy war-tax at Ta 
Tung, while duty and war-tax were entirely free 
at Wuhu. 

In this expedition of inspection, I chose Wuhu 
as the basis of my operation. I started with four 
Chinese tea-men, natives of Taiping who had 
fled to Shanghai as refugees when the whole 
district was changed into a theatre of bloody 
conflicts between the imperialist and rebel forces 
for two years. On the way up the Wuhu River, 
we passed three cities mostly deserted by their 
inhabitants, but occupied by rebels. Paddy 
fields on both sides of the river were mostly left 
uncultivated and deserted, overrun with rank 
weeds and tall grass. As we ascended towards 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPIXG DISTRICT 127 

Taiping, the whole region presented a heart- 
rending and depressing scene of wild waste and 
devastation. Whole villages were depopulated 
and left in a dilapidated condition. Out of a 
population of 500,000 only a few dozen people 
were seen wandering about in a listless, hopeless 
condition very much emaciated and looking like 
walking skeletons. 

After a week's journey we reached the village 
of San Kow, where we were met and welcomed 
by three tea-men who had been in Shanghai 
about four years previous* It seemed that they 
had succeeded in weathering the storm which had 
swept away the bulk of the population and left 
them among the surviving few. They were 
mighty glad to see us, and our appearance in the 
village seemed to be a God-send. Among the 
houses that were left intact, I selected the best 
of them to be my headquarters for the transaction 
of the tea business. The old tea-men were 
brought in to co-operate in the business and they 
showed us where the tea was stored. I was told 
that in San Kow there were at least five hundred 
thousand boxes, but in the whole district of 
Taiping there were at least a million and a half 
boxes, about sixty pounds of tea to a box. 

At the end of another week, I returned to 



128 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Wuhu and reported all particulars. I had found 
that the way up from Wuhu by river to Taiping 
was perfectly safe and I did not anticipate any 
danger to life or treasure. I had seen a large 
quantity of the green tea myself and found out 
that all that was needed was to ship as much 
treasure as it was safe to have housed in Wuhu, 
and from there to have it transferred in country 
tea-boats, well escorted by men in case of any 
emergency. I also sent samples of the different 
kinds of green tea to Shanghai to be inspected 
and listed. These proved to be satisfactory, and 
the order came back to buy as much of the stock 
as could be bought. 

I was appointed the head of all succeeding ex- 
peditions to escort treasure up the river to San 
Kow and cargoes of tea from there to Wuhu. 
In one of these expeditions, I had a staff of six 
Europeans and an equal number of Chinese 
tea-men. We had eight boxes of treasure con- 
taining altogether Tls. 40,000. A tael, in the 
sixties, according to the exchange of that period, 
was equal to $1.33, making the total amount in 
Mexican dollars to be a little over $53,000. We 
had a fleet of eight tea-boats, four large ones and 
four smaller ones. The treasure was divided 
into two equal parts and was placed in the two 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 129 

largest and staunchest boats. The men were 
also divided into two squads, three Europeans 
and three Chinese in one large boat and an equal 
number in the other. We were well provided 
with firearms, revolvers and cutlasses. Besides 
the six Europeans, we had about forty men 
including the boatmen, but neither the six tea- 
men nor the boatmen could be relied upon to 
show fight in case of emergency. The only 
reliable men I had to fall back upon, in case of 
emergency, were the Europeans; even in these 
I was not sure I could place implicit confidence, 
for they were principally runaway sailors of an 
adventurous character picked up in Shanghai 
by the company and sent up to Wuhu to escort 
the treasure up to the interior. Among them 
was an Englishman who professed to be a vet- 
erinary doctor. He was over six feet tall in his 
stocking feet, a man of fine personal appearance, 
but he did not prove himself to be of very stout 
heart, as may be seen presently. Thus prepared 
and equipped, we left Wuhu in fine spirits. We 
proceeded on our journey a little beyond the city 
of King Yuen, which is about half the way to 
San Kow. We could have gone a little beyond 
King Yuen, but thinking it might be safer to be 
near the city, where the rebel chief had seen my 



130 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

passport, obtained in Nanking, and knew that 
I had influential people in Nanking, we con- 
cluded to pass the night in a safe secluded 
little cove in the hend of the river just large 
enough for our little boats to moor close to each 
other, taking due precaution to place the two 
largest ones in the center, flanked by the other 
boats on the right and left of them; the smal- 
ler boats occupied the extreme ends of the 
line. 

Before retiring, I had ordered all our firearms 
to be examined and loaded and properly dis- 
tributed. Watchmen were stationed in each 
boat to keep watch all night, for which they were 
to be paid extra. The precautionary steps hav- 
ing thus been taken, we all retired for the night. 
An old tea-man and myself were the only ones 
who lay wide awake while the rest gave unmis- 
takable signs of deep sleep. I felt somewhat 
nervous and could not sleep. The new moon had 
peeked in upon us occasionally with her cold 
smile, as heavy and dark clouds were scudding 
across her path. Soon she was shut in and 
disappeared, and all was shrouded in pitch dark- 
ness. The night was nearly half spent, when my 
ears caught the distant sound of whooping and 
yelling which seemed to increase in volume. I 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 131 

immediately started up to dress myself and 
quietly woke up the Europeans and Chinese in 
both boats. As the yelling and whooping drew 
nearer and nearer it seemed to come from a 
thousand throats, filling the midnight air with 
unearthly sounds. In another instant countless 
torch lights were seen dancing and whirling in 
the dismal darkness right on the opposite bank. 
Fortunately the river was between this maraud- 
ing band and us, while pitch darkness concealed 
our boats from their sight. In view of such 
impending danger, we held a council of war. 
None of us were disposed to fight and endanger 
our lives in a conflict in which the odds were 
fearfully against us, there being about a 
thousand to one. But the English veterinary 
doctor was the foremost and most strenuous of 
the Europeans to advocate passive surrender. 
His countenance actually turned pale and he 
trembled all over, whether from fear or the chilly 
atmosphere of the night I could not tell. Hav- 
ing heard from each one what he had to say, 
I could do nothing but step forward and speak 
to them, which I did in this wise: "Well, boys, 
you have all decided not to fight in case we are 
attacked, but to surrender our treasure. The 
ground for taking such a step is that we are sure 



132 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

to be outnumbered by a rebel host* So that in 
such a dilemma discretion is the better part of 
valor, and Tls. 40,000 are not worth sacrificing 
our lives for. But by surrendering our trust 
without making an eif ort of some kind to save 
it, we would be branded as unmitigated cowards, 
and we could never expect to be trusted with 
any responsible commission again* Now, I will 
tell you what I propose to do* If the rebel horde 
should come over and attempt to seize our 
treasure, I will spring forward with my yellow^ 
silk passport, and demand to see their chief, 
while you fellows with your guns and arms must 
stand by the treasure. Do not fire and start the 
fight. By parleying with them, it will for the 
moment check their determination to plunder, 
and they will have a chance to find out who we 
are, and where I obtained the passport; and, 
even if they should carry off the treasure, I shall 
tell their chief that I will surely report the whole 
proceeding in Nanking and recover every cent 
of our loss." 

These remarks seemed to revive the spirit and 
courage of the men, after which we all sat on the 
forward decks of our boats anxiously waiting for 
what the next moment would bring forth. 
While in this state of expectancy, our hearts 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 133 

palpitating in an audible fashion, our eyes were 
watching intently the opposite shore. All the 
shouting and yelling seemed to have died away, 
and nothing could be seen but torches moving 
about slowly and leisurely in regular detach- 
ments, each detachment stopping occasionally 
and then moving on again. This was kept up 
for over two hours, while they constantly 
receded from us. I asked an old boatman the 
meaning of such movements and was told that 
the marauding horde was embarking in boats 
along the whole line of the opposite shore and 
was moving down stream. It was three o'clock 
in the morning, and it began to rain. A few of 
the advance boats had passed us without dis- 
covering where we were. They were loaded with 
men and floated by us in silence. By four 
o'clock the last boats followed the rest and soon 
disappeared from sight. Evidently, from the 
stillness that characterized the long line of boats 
as they floated down stream, the buccaneering 
horde was completely used up by their looting 
expedition, and at once abandoned themselves 
to sound sleep when they got on board the boats. 
We thanked our stars for such a narrow escape 
from such an unlooked-for danger. We owed our 
safety to the darkness of the night, the rain and 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

to the fact that we were on the opposite shore in 
a retired cove. By five o'clock all our anxieties 
and fears were laid aside and turned into joy 
and thankfulness. We resumed our journey 
with light hearts and reached San Kow two days 
later in peace and safety. In less than two 
weeks we sent down to Wuhu, escorted by 
Europeans and tea-men, the first installment, 
consisting of fifteen boatloads of tea to be 
transhipped by steamer to Shanghai. The next 
installment consisted of twelve boatloads. I 
escorted that down the river in person. The 
river, in some places, especially in the summer, 
was quite shallow and a way had to be dug to 
float the boats down. In one or two instances 
the boatmen were very reluctant to jump into 
the water to do the work of deepening the river, 
and on one occasion I had to jump in, with the 
water up to my waist, in order to set them an 
example. When they caught the idea and saw 
me in the water, every man followed my example 
and vied with each other in clearing a way for 
the boats, for they saw I meant business and 
there was no fooling about it either. 

I was engaged in this Taiping tea business for 
about six months, and took away about sixty-five 
thousand boxes of tea, which was hardly a tenth 



EXPEDITION TO TAIPING DISTRICT 135 

part of the entire stock found in the district. 
Then I was taken down with the fever and ague 
of the worst type. As I could get no medical 
relief at Wuhu, I was obliged to return to 
Shanghai, where I was laid up sick for nearly 
two months. Those two months of sickness had 
knocked all ideas of making a big fortune out of 
my head. I gave up the Taiping tea enterprise, 
because it called for a greater sacrifice of health 
and wear upon my nervous system than I was 
able to stand. The King Yuen midnight inci- 
dent, which came near proving a disastrous one 
for me, with the marauding horde of unscrupu- 
lous cut-throats, had been quite a shock on my 
nervous system at the time and may have been 
the primal cause of my two months' sickness ; it 
served as a sufficient warning to me not to tax 
my nervous system by further encounters and 
disputes with the rebel chiefs, whose price on the 
tea we bought of them was being increased every 
day. A dispassionate and calm view of the enter- 
prise convinced me that I would have to preserve 
my life, strength and energy for a higher and 
worthier object than any fortune I might make 
out of this Taiping tea, which, after all, was 
plundered property. I am sure that no fortune 
In the world could be brought in the balance to 



136 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

weigh against my life, which is of inestimable 
value to me. 

Although I had made nothing out of the 
Taiping teas, yet the fearless spirit, the deter- 
mination to succeed, and the pluck to be able to 
do what few would undertake in face of excep- 
tional difficulties and hazards, that I had 
exhibited in the enterprise, were in themselves 
assets worth more to me than a fortune. I was 
well-known, both among foreign merchants and 
native business men, so that as soon as it was 
known that I had given up the Taiping tea 
enterprise on account of health, I was offered a 
tea agency in the port of Kew Keang for pack- 
ing teas for another foreign firm. I accepted it 
as a temporary shift, but gave it up in less than 
six months and started a commission business on 
my own account. I continued this business for 
nearly three years and was doing as well as I 
had expected to do. It was at this time while in 
Kew Keang that I caught the first ray of hope 
of materializing the educational scheme I had 
been weaving during the last year of my college 
life.
