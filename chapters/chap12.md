CHAPTER XII 

EXPEDITION TO THE TAIPING TEA 
DISTRICT 

My Nanking visit was utterly barren of any 
substantial hope of promoting any scheme of 
educational or political reform for the general 
welfare of China or for the advancement of my 
personal interest. When I was thoroughly con- 
vinced that neither the reformation nor the 
regeneration of China was to come from the Tai- 
pings, I at once turned my thoughts to the idea 
of making a big fortune as my first duty, and 
as the first element in the successful carrying out 
of other plans for the future. 

One day, while sauntering about in the tea 
garden inside the city of Shanghai, I came across 
a few tea-merchants regaling themselves with 
that beverage in a booth by themselves, evidently 
having a very social time. They beckoned to me 
to join their party. In the course of the conver- 
sation, we happened to touch on my late journey 
through the tea districts of Hunan, Hupeh and 
Kiang Si and also my trip to Nanking. Passing 
from one topic of conversation to another, we 
lighted upon the subject of the green tea district 
of Taiping in An Hwui province. It was stated 
that an immense quantity of green tea could be 
found there, all packed and boxed ready for 
shipment, and that the rebels were in possession 
of the goods, and that whoever had the hardihood 
and courage to risk his life to gain possession of 
it would become a millionaire. I listened to the 
account with deep and absorbing interest, taking 
in everything that was said on the subject. It 
was stated that there were over 1,000,000 chests 
of tea there. Finally the party broke up, and 
I wended my way to my quarters completely 
absorbed in deep thought. I reasoned with 
myself that this was a chance for me to make a 
fortune, but wondered who would be foolhardy 
enough to furnish the capital, thinking that no 
business man of practical experience would risk 
his money in such a wild goose adventure, sur- 
rounded as it was with more than ordinary 
dangers and difficulties, in a country where 
highway robbery, lawlessness and murder were 
of daily occurrence. But with the glamor of a 
big fortune confronting me, all privations, 
dangers and risks of life seemed small and faded 
into airy nothing. 

My friend, Tsang Mew, who had been instru- 
mental in having me sent traveling into the 
interior a year before, was a man of great 
business experience. He had a long head and a 
large circle of business acquaintances, besides 
being my warm friend, so I concluded to go to 
him and talk over the whole matter, as I knew 
he would not hesitate to give me his best advice. 
I laid the whole subject before him. He said he 
would consider the matter fully and in a few 
days let me know what he had decided to do 
about it. After a few days, he told me that he 
had had several consultations with the head of 
the firm, of which he was comprador, and be- 
tween them the company had decided to take up 
my project. 

The plan of operation as mapped out by me 
was as follows: I was to go to the district of 
Taiping by the shortest and safest route possible, 
to find out whether the quantity of tea did exist; 
whether it was safe to have treasure taken up 
there to pay the rebels for the tea; and whether 
it was possible to have the tea supply taken down 
by native boats to be transhipped by steamer to 
Shanghai. This might be called the preliminary 
expedition. Then, I was to determine which of 
the two routes would be the more feasible, 
there being two, one by way of Wuhu, a treaty 
port, and another by way of Ta Tung, not a 
treaty port, a hundred miles above Wuhu. 
Wuhu and the whole country leading to 
Taiping, including the district itself, was under 
the jurisdiction of the rebels, whereas Ta Tung 
was still in possession of the imperialists. From 
Wuhu to Taiping by river the distance was 
about two hundred and fifty miles, whereas, by 
way of Ta Tung, the way, though shorter, 
was mostly overland, which made transportation 
more difficult and expensive, besides having to 
pay the imperialists a heavy war-tax at Ta 
Tung, while duty and war-tax were entirely free 
at Wuhu. 

In this expedition of inspection, I chose Wuhu 
as the basis of my operation. I started with four 
Chinese tea-men, natives of Taiping who had 
fled to Shanghai as refugees when the whole 
district was changed into a theatre of bloody 
conflicts between the imperialist and rebel forces 
for two years. On the way up the Wuhu River, 
we passed three cities mostly deserted by their 
inhabitants, but occupied by rebels. Paddy 
fields on both sides of the river were mostly left 
uncultivated and deserted, overrun with rank 
weeds and tall grass. As we ascended towards 
Taiping, the whole region presented a heart- 
rending and depressing scene of wild waste and 
devastation. Whole villages were depopulated 
and left in a dilapidated condition. Out of a 
population of 500,000 only a few dozen people 
were seen wandering about in a listless, hopeless 
condition very much emaciated and looking like 
walking skeletons. 

After a week's journey we reached the village 
of San Kow, where we were met and welcomed 
by three tea-men who had been in Shanghai 
about four years previous* It seemed that they 
had succeeded in weathering the storm which had 
swept away the bulk of the population and left 
them among the surviving few. They were 
mighty glad to see us, and our appearance in the 
village seemed to be a God-send. Among the 
houses that were left intact, I selected the best 
of them to be my headquarters for the transaction 
of the tea business. The old tea-men were 
brought in to co-operate in the business and they 
showed us where the tea was stored. I was told 
that in San Kow there were at least five hundred 
thousand boxes, but in the whole district of 
Taiping there were at least a million and a half 
boxes, about sixty pounds of tea to a box. 

At the end of another week, I returned to 
Wuhu and reported all particulars. I had found 
that the way up from Wuhu by river to Taiping 
was perfectly safe and I did not anticipate any 
danger to life or treasure. I had seen a large 
quantity of the green tea myself and found out 
that all that was needed was to ship as much 
treasure as it was safe to have housed in Wuhu, 
and from there to have it transferred in country 
tea-boats, well escorted by men in case of any 
emergency. I also sent samples of the different 
kinds of green tea to Shanghai to be inspected 
and listed. These proved to be satisfactory, and 
the order came back to buy as much of the stock 
as could be bought. 

I was appointed the head of all succeeding ex- 
peditions to escort treasure up the river to San 
Kow and cargoes of tea from there to Wuhu. 
In one of these expeditions, I had a staff of six 
Europeans and an equal number of Chinese 
tea-men. We had eight boxes of treasure con- 
taining altogether Tls. 40,000. A tael, in the 
sixties, according to the exchange of that period, 
was equal to $1.33, making the total amount in 
Mexican dollars to be a little over $53,000. We 
had a fleet of eight tea-boats, four large ones and 
four smaller ones. The treasure was divided 
into two equal parts and was placed in the two 
largest and staunchest boats. The men were 
also divided into two squads, three Europeans 
and three Chinese in one large boat and an equal 
number in the other. We were well provided 
with firearms, revolvers and cutlasses. Besides 
the six Europeans, we had about forty men 
including the boatmen, but neither the six tea- 
men nor the boatmen could be relied upon to 
show fight in case of emergency. The only 
reliable men I had to fall back upon, in case of 
emergency, were the Europeans; even in these 
I was not sure I could place implicit confidence, 
for they were principally runaway sailors of an 
adventurous character picked up in Shanghai 
by the company and sent up to Wuhu to escort 
the treasure up to the interior. Among them 
was an Englishman who professed to be a vet- 
erinary doctor. He was over six feet tall in his 
stocking feet, a man of fine personal appearance, 
but he did not prove himself to be of very stout 
heart, as may be seen presently. Thus prepared 
and equipped, we left Wuhu in fine spirits. We 
proceeded on our journey a little beyond the city 
of King Yuen, which is about half the way to 
San Kow. We could have gone a little beyond 
King Yuen, but thinking it might be safer to be 
near the city, where the rebel chief had seen my 
passport, obtained in Nanking, and knew that 
I had influential people in Nanking, we con- 
cluded to pass the night in a safe secluded 
little cove in the hend of the river just large 
enough for our little boats to moor close to each 
other, taking due precaution to place the two 
largest ones in the center, flanked by the other 
boats on the right and left of them; the smal- 
ler boats occupied the extreme ends of the 
line. 



第十二章
前往太平茶区的探险

我在南京的访问完全没有带来任何实质性的希望，无法推动任何旨在中国社会福祉或我个人利益发展的教育或政治改革方案。当我彻底确信，太平军既不会带来中国的改革，也无法使其复兴时，我立即转而考虑如何大发一笔横财，将此作为我首要的责任，也作为我未来其他计划成功实施的首要前提。

一天，我在上海城内的茶园中闲逛时，碰到几位茶商正围坐在一处茶棚里饮茶叙谈，气氛颇为热络。他们招呼我加入他们的谈话。闲聊中，我们谈到了我最近对湖南、湖北和江西茶区的考察之行，以及我去南京的经历。话题辗转，谈到了安徽太平绿茶产区。他们说，那里有大量的绿茶早已包装装箱，随时可供运送，但现由叛军掌控。任何人若敢冒险深入夺取这些茶叶，便有可能一夜暴富。我对此说法极感兴趣，凝神细听，毫无遗漏。据说那里的茶叶多达一百万箱。最后，这场聚会结束，我独自返回住处，心中沉思不已。我对自己说，这是我发财的机会，但谁会愚蠢到愿意投资这样一次充满危险、困难重重的“愚人冒险”呢？在这样一个每天都发生抢劫、无法无天和谋杀的国家，恐怕没有一个有实战经验的商人愿意涉险。然而，发财的幻想如此诱人，所有的艰难、危险和生命风险仿佛都变得微不足道，如同轻烟一般消散。

我的朋友曾缪，正是前一年促成我内地之行的那位人物，他是一位极富商业经验的人，头脑冷静、人脉广泛，并且与我私交甚笃。我决定将整件事告诉他，与他详谈，因为我知道他一定会毫无保留地给我最中肯的建议。我将整个计划向他倾诉，他表示愿意认真考虑此事，并将在数日后给我明确答复。几天后，他告诉我，他已与他所任买办的洋行的主管多次磋商，双方决定采纳我的方案。

我拟定的执行计划如下：我将以最短、最安全的路线前往太平茶区，调查是否真有如此多的茶叶存货；携带大笔银两前去向叛军购买茶叶是否安全；并评估能否用当地船只将这些茶叶运下水路，再转由轮船运往上海。这可算是一次前期的勘察之行。随后，我还需判断两条路线哪一条更为可行：一条是经过条约口岸芜湖，另一条则是经过距芜湖百里之遥的非条约口岸打同（Ta Tung）。芜湖、通往太平的沿途地区及太平本地都归叛军控制，而打同仍为清军掌控。从芜湖顺江到太平约有250英里；而打同路线虽更短，但多为陆路，运输既艰难又成本高昂，还需在打同向清军缴纳重税，而芜湖则完全免于赋税与战时徵费。

在这次考察性出行中，我选择芜湖为基地。我随行的有四位中国茶人，皆是太平本地人，在太平地区变成清军与叛军两年血战战场后，逃亡至上海的难民。在沿芜湖江而上的途中，我们经过三座已被大部分居民遗弃的城市，这些城市现由叛军占据。江岸两旁的稻田多荒芜失修，杂草丛生。越接近太平，景象越凄凉，满目疮痍，残破荒芜令人心碎。许多村庄已无人居住，破败不堪。原有五十万人的地区，如今只剩零星数十人在村中游荡，面容枯槁，仿佛行尸走肉。

一个星期后，我们抵达三口村（San Kow），受到三位曾在四年前到过上海的茶人热情迎接。看起来他们在这场席卷整个地区的人祸中幸存下来，如今成为幸存者中的一部分。他们见到我们异常欣喜，我们的到来仿佛是上天所赐。我在尚完好的几所房屋中挑选了一所最好的，作为处理茶务的总部。这些老茶人也加入了合作，他们带我们查看了茶叶的储藏地点。据称，仅三口村就有约五十万箱茶，而整个太平茶区至少有一百五十万箱，每箱约重六十磅。

又过了一周，我返回芜湖，详细汇报了所有情况。我发现从芜湖溯江而上前往太平的水路十分安全，无论运送银两还是人员都没有大的生命危险。我亲眼见到大量绿茶，并确认唯一所需之事就是运来足够的银两，安全存放于芜湖，再以乡船装载，配备人员护送以应不时之需。我还将各种绿茶样品送往上海检验和定级，反馈良好，随即下达指示，尽可能多地购入库存。

我被任命为所有后续探险运输行动的总负责人，负责押运银两前往三口村，并将茶叶从三口村运至芜湖。在其中一次行动中，我的团队包括六名欧洲人及六名中国茶人。我们运送的银两共八箱，总值为四万两白银（Tls. 40,000）。以1860年代的汇率计算，一两约值1.33美元，折合墨西哥银元略超五万三千元。我们配备了八艘茶船，四大四小。银两被平均分装在最结实的两艘大船中。人员也分为两组，每组三名欧洲人及三名中国人，分别搭乘这两艘大船。我们携带充足的火器、左轮手枪及短剑。除六位欧洲人外，我们还有约四十名人员，包括船夫，但无论是六名茶人还是船夫，在遇紧急情况时都难以指望他们奋勇作战。我唯一能指望的，是那些欧洲人；但即便是他们，我也不敢完全信任，因为他们大多是从上海雇来的亡命水手，性格冒险，由公司指派护送银两前往内地。

其中有一位自称是兽医的英国人，赤足身高六尺有余，外表威武，但后来证明他并非真正的硬汉，这点之后会看到。我们准备妥当、士气高涨，从芜湖启程，顺利行至庆源城外，约是到三口村的一半路程。其实本可继续前进，但出于谨慎考虑，我们决定就近扎营，因为当地的叛军首领曾在南京见过我的通行证，也知道我在南京有人脉。于是，我们选择在一处安全的隐蔽河湾过夜，刚好容得下所有小船靠泊。我特别安排将两艘装载银两的大船停在中央，左右由其他船只护卫，最小的船位于队列两端。



Before retiring, I had ordered all our firearms 
to be examined and loaded and properly dis- 
tributed. Watchmen were stationed in each 
boat to keep watch all night, for which they were 
to be paid extra. The precautionary steps hav- 
ing thus been taken, we all retired for the night. 
An old tea-man and myself were the only ones 
who lay wide awake while the rest gave unmis- 
takable signs of deep sleep. I felt somewhat 
nervous and could not sleep. The new moon had 
peeked in upon us occasionally with her cold 
smile, as heavy and dark clouds were scudding 
across her path. Soon she was shut in and 
disappeared, and all was shrouded in pitch dark- 
ness. The night was nearly half spent, when my 
ears caught the distant sound of whooping and 
yelling which seemed to increase in volume. I 
immediately started up to dress myself and 
quietly woke up the Europeans and Chinese in 
both boats. As the yelling and whooping drew 
nearer and nearer it seemed to come from a 
thousand throats, filling the midnight air with 
unearthly sounds. In another instant countless 
torch lights were seen dancing and whirling in 
the dismal darkness right on the opposite bank. 
Fortunately the river was between this maraud- 
ing band and us, while pitch darkness concealed 
our boats from their sight. In view of such 
impending danger, we held a council of war. 
None of us were disposed to fight and endanger 
our lives in a conflict in which the odds were 
fearfully against us, there being about a 
thousand to one. But the English veterinary 
doctor was the foremost and most strenuous of 
the Europeans to advocate passive surrender. 
His countenance actually turned pale and he 
trembled all over, whether from fear or the chilly 
atmosphere of the night I could not tell. Hav- 
ing heard from each one what he had to say, 
I could do nothing but step forward and speak 
to them, which I did in this wise: "Well, boys, 
you have all decided not to fight in case we are 
attacked, but to surrender our treasure. The 
ground for taking such a step is that we are sure 
to be outnumbered by a rebel host* So that in 
such a dilemma discretion is the better part of 
valor, and Tls. 40,000 are not worth sacrificing 
our lives for. But by surrendering our trust 
without making an eif ort of some kind to save 
it, we would be branded as unmitigated cowards, 
and we could never expect to be trusted with 
any responsible commission again* Now, I will 
tell you what I propose to do* If the rebel horde 
should come over and attempt to seize our 
treasure, I will spring forward with my yellow^ 
silk passport, and demand to see their chief, 
while you fellows with your guns and arms must 
stand by the treasure. Do not fire and start the 
fight. By parleying with them, it will for the 
moment check their determination to plunder, 
and they will have a chance to find out who we 
are, and where I obtained the passport; and, 
even if they should carry off the treasure, I shall 
tell their chief that I will surely report the whole 
proceeding in Nanking and recover every cent 
of our loss." 

These remarks seemed to revive the spirit and 
courage of the men, after which we all sat on the 
forward decks of our boats anxiously waiting for 
what the next moment would bring forth. 
While in this state of expectancy, our hearts 
palpitating in an audible fashion, our eyes were 
watching intently the opposite shore. All the 
shouting and yelling seemed to have died away, 
and nothing could be seen but torches moving 
about slowly and leisurely in regular detach- 
ments, each detachment stopping occasionally 
and then moving on again. This was kept up 
for over two hours, while they constantly 
receded from us. I asked an old boatman the 
meaning of such movements and was told that 
the marauding horde was embarking in boats 
along the whole line of the opposite shore and 
was moving down stream. It was three o'clock 
in the morning, and it began to rain. A few of 
the advance boats had passed us without dis- 
covering where we were. They were loaded with 
men and floated by us in silence. By four 
o'clock the last boats followed the rest and soon 
disappeared from sight. Evidently, from the 
stillness that characterized the long line of boats 
as they floated down stream, the buccaneering 
horde was completely used up by their looting 
expedition, and at once abandoned themselves 
to sound sleep when they got on board the boats. 
We thanked our stars for such a narrow escape 
from such an unlooked-for danger. We owed our 
safety to the darkness of the night, the rain and 
to the fact that we were on the opposite shore in 
a retired cove. By five o'clock all our anxieties 
and fears were laid aside and turned into joy 
and thankfulness. We resumed our journey 
with light hearts and reached San Kow two days 
later in peace and safety. In less than two 
weeks we sent down to Wuhu, escorted by 
Europeans and tea-men, the first installment, 
consisting of fifteen boatloads of tea to be 
transhipped by steamer to Shanghai. The next 
installment consisted of twelve boatloads. I 
escorted that down the river in person. The 
river, in some places, especially in the summer, 
was quite shallow and a way had to be dug to 
float the boats down. In one or two instances 
the boatmen were very reluctant to jump into 
the water to do the work of deepening the river, 
and on one occasion I had to jump in, with the 
water up to my waist, in order to set them an 
example. When they caught the idea and saw 
me in the water, every man followed my example 
and vied with each other in clearing a way for 
the boats, for they saw I meant business and 
there was no fooling about it either. 

I was engaged in this Taiping tea business for 
about six months, and took away about sixty-five 
thousand boxes of tea, which was hardly a tenth 
part of the entire stock found in the district. 
Then I was taken down with the fever and ague 
of the worst type. As I could get no medical 
relief at Wuhu, I was obliged to return to 
Shanghai, where I was laid up sick for nearly 
two months. Those two months of sickness had 
knocked all ideas of making a big fortune out of 
my head. I gave up the Taiping tea enterprise, 
because it called for a greater sacrifice of health 
and wear upon my nervous system than I was 
able to stand. The King Yuen midnight inci- 
dent, which came near proving a disastrous one 
for me, with the marauding horde of unscrupu- 
lous cut-throats, had been quite a shock on my 
nervous system at the time and may have been 
the primal cause of my two months' sickness ; it 
served as a sufficient warning to me not to tax 
my nervous system by further encounters and 
disputes with the rebel chiefs, whose price on the 
tea we bought of them was being increased every 
day. A dispassionate and calm view of the enter- 
prise convinced me that I would have to preserve 
my life, strength and energy for a higher and 
worthier object than any fortune I might make 
out of this Taiping tea, which, after all, was 
plundered property. I am sure that no fortune 
In the world could be brought in the balance to 
weigh against my life, which is of inestimable 
value to me. 

Although I had made nothing out of the 
Taiping teas, yet the fearless spirit, the deter- 
mination to succeed, and the pluck to be able to 
do what few would undertake in face of excep- 
tional difficulties and hazards, that I had 
exhibited in the enterprise, were in themselves 
assets worth more to me than a fortune. I was 
well-known, both among foreign merchants and 
native business men, so that as soon as it was 
known that I had given up the Taiping tea 
enterprise on account of health, I was offered a 
tea agency in the port of Kew Keang for pack- 
ing teas for another foreign firm. I accepted it 
as a temporary shift, but gave it up in less than 
six months and started a commission business on 
my own account. I continued this business for 
nearly three years and was doing as well as I 
had expected to do. It was at this time while in 
Kew Keang that I caught the first ray of hope 
of materializing the educational scheme I had 
been weaving during the last year of my college 
life. 


在我准备就寝前，我命令所有人检查并装填武器，并妥善分发。每艘船上都安排了守夜人通宵值班，事后可得额外报酬。一切防范措施就绪后，我们便各自就寝。除了我和一位老茶商，其他人都沉沉入睡，鼾声不绝。我却因内心不安，辗转反侧难以入眠。新月偶尔从乌云缝隙中露出一抹冷笑，不久又被密云遮蔽，四周陷入一片伸手不见五指的黑暗。

夜深过半时，我耳边忽然传来远处阵阵呼喊声，音量渐增。我立即起身穿衣，悄声唤醒两艘大船上的欧洲人和中国人。呼喊声越发靠近，仿佛千万喉舌齐声，撕破夜幕。转眼间，无数火把在对岸的黑暗中舞动旋转，跳跃不止。幸而我们与这股劫掠之徒隔着一条河流，又得黑夜掩护，使他们无法察觉我们的行踪。面对这突如其来的危机，我们召开了紧急会议。无人愿意冒险迎战，在敌众我寡的情况下拼死搏斗无异于送死——敌方人数恐有千倍于我。

最先主张不战而降的是那位英国“兽医”，他在欧洲人中最为怯懦。他面如死灰，浑身颤抖，不知是因寒夜冷意，还是恐惧所致。大家发言完毕，我只得上前说道：

“各位兄弟，你们都决定若遇袭击便不抵抗，拱手交出宝藏。你们的理由是，我们必将被数量压倒，此时审慎远胜勇敢，四万两银子不足以换命。然而，若我们在毫无抵抗之下投降，今后再无任何人敢将重任托付于我们。我们将被视作懦夫、无能之辈。

我来说说我的打算。如果敌人真的越过河来抢劫宝藏，我将率先上前，出示我的黄色丝质通行证，要求见他们的首领。你们则守住宝藏，不得开火。只要能拖延片刻，他们便有机会查明我们的身份，以及我通行证的来源。即便最终他们带走财宝，我也会向其首领声明，我将向南京当局据理力争，追回每一分损失。”

我这番话似乎重燃众人斗志，大家精神一振，随后我们全都坐在船头甲板上，焦急等待接下来将会发生的事。我们心跳剧烈，目不转睛地盯着对岸。呼喊声逐渐消退，只见火把分成数股缓缓移动，时而停下，时而继续，仿佛在排兵布阵。如此持续两个多小时，火把渐行渐远。

我问一位老船夫这是什么情形，他告诉我，那些劫匪正沿对岸全线上船，顺流而下。此时是凌晨三点，天开始下雨。几艘先头船只悄然经过我们，没有发现我们的藏身处。这些船装满了人，但一声不响地漂过。到四点钟时，最后一艘也消失在夜幕中。

从这支行进中鸦雀无声的队伍判断，这帮海盗劫掠过后疲惫不堪，上船后便沉沉睡去。我们暗自庆幸能从这场突如其来的危机中死里逃生。我们的安全归功于深夜的黑暗、突来的雨水以及我们位于隐蔽湾中的有利位置。到了清晨五点，我们的焦虑尽皆消散，转为感恩与喜悦。

我们满怀轻松继续上行，两天后平安抵达三口村。不出两周，我们便由欧洲人与茶商护送，将第一批茶——十五船——运往芜湖，再转运至上海。第二批共十二船，由我亲自护送下行。夏季时河道水浅，我们不得不人工疏浚以利船行。有一两次船夫不肯下水干活，我只得亲自跳入齐腰深的河水，以身作则。他们见我真动手了，纷纷效仿，争先恐后地为船开路，因为他们明白，我不是在说空话。

我从事太平茶业约半年时间，共运出约六万五千箱茶叶，仅占当地库存的十分之一。我后来感染严重的瘴疟热，在芜湖无法就医，被迫返回上海，在病榻上卧床近两个月。那两个月的病痛彻底击碎了我发财致富的幻想。我决定放弃太平茶业，因为它对健康和神经系统的消耗远超我所能承受。京源夜半惊魂，那群毫无良知的匪徒差点让我命丧当场，对我的神经是一次沉重打击，也很可能是引发这场重病的直接原因。它足以警示我，不应再与叛军首领周旋、讨价还价——他们的要价日益高涨。

冷静客观地审视整个企业，我意识到自己应将生命、精力与意志保留给更高尚、更有价值的事业，而不是追逐这些本质上是掠夺而来的“太平茶”。我深知，再多的财富也无法与我的生命相比，后者对我而言，是无价之宝。

虽然我未从太平茶业中获得财富，但我在此过程中展现出的无畏精神、坚定信念与胆识——敢于面对种种异常艰难与危险——本身就是比金钱更珍贵的财富。此举使我在外商与本地商人中声名远扬。因此，当人们得知我因健康原因放弃太平茶业后，我很快便在九江口岸获得了一份外商茶叶打包代理的职务。我接受了这项临时工作，但不到半年便辞职，自立门户开展洋行代理业务。我经营此业近三年，业绩达成预期。

正是在九江期间，我第一次看到将我大学时期筹划的教育计划变为现实的曙光。

在就寝前，我已下令将所有枪支检查装弹并合理分配。每条船上都安排了守夜人通宵警戒，为此他们可获得额外报酬。采取这些防范措施后，我们便各自安歇。整夜只有老茶师与我清醒无眠，其余人皆酣然沉睡。我心神不宁难以入眠，新月时而从翻卷的乌云间隙投来冷冽微笑，不久便完全隐没，天地陷入浓墨般的黑暗。夜半时分，远处突然传来渐趋响亮的呼哨呐喊，我立即起身更衣，悄然唤醒两船中外人员。那鬼魅般的嘶吼越来越近，仿佛千人同啸划破午夜。转瞬间，无数火把在对岸幽暗中诡谲舞动。所幸河流横亘在这群劫匪与我们之间，漆黑夜色也掩蔽了我们的船只。面对迫近的危险，我们召开紧急会议。鉴于敌我数量悬殊达千比一，无人愿以卵击石。英国兽医医生最为激烈主张投降，他面如土色浑身战栗——不知是因恐惧抑或夜寒。听取众人意见后，我上前说道："诸位既决意不战而降，是因叛军势众。审时度势确属明智，四万两银子不值得以命相搏。但若不作任何抵抗就放弃受托之财，我们将永远背负懦夫骂名，再难膺重任。我提议：待叛军渡河时，我将持黄绸护照求见其首领，你们持枪守卫银箱但切勿开火。周旋之际或可暂遏其劫掠之心，他们也会查明我们身份及护照来历。纵使银两被夺，我必向其首领声明将赴南京禀报此事追回分文。"

这番话重振了士气，众人遂在船首甲板焦灼待命。此时对岸呼哨声渐息，唯见火把分队缓移，时而驻足。老船夫解释这是匪群正登船顺流而下。凌晨三点落雨时，几艘先锋船载满静默的匪徒与我们擦身而过。至四点末批船只消失于视线，整支船队寂静下行，显见这群海盗已因劫掠精疲力竭，登船便酣然入睡。我们庆幸因夜色、雨幕及僻静河湾逃过一劫。五点时恐惧尽消，我们满怀感恩轻装启程，两日后平安抵达三沟。半月内我们分两批将茶叶运往芜湖：首批十五船由欧籍护卫押运，次批十二船由我亲送。夏季浅滩处需人工挖道行船，有次船夫畏缩不前，我率先踏入齐腰深水示范，众人见状争相效仿疏通航道。

此番太平军茶叶贸易历时六月，运出六万五千箱（不及当地存量十分之一），后我染恶性疟疾，因芜湖缺医被迫返沪，卧床两月。这场大病击碎了我的淘金梦，意识到太平军茶叶生意对健康的损耗远超承受。王源午夜遭遇亡命之徒的惊魂时刻，或许正是致病主因，这警示我不能再以神经系统的代价与日益抬价的叛军首领周旋。冷静思量后，我确信生命比劫掠得来的茶叶财富更珍贵。

虽然未从太平军茶叶中获利，但我在重重险境中展现的胆识与魄力，已为我在中外商界赢得超越金钱的声誉。放弃茶叶生意后，我很快受聘为九江港茶叶代理，但未满半年便自立门户经营经纪业务。正是在九江期间，我大学末年酝酿的教育计划首次闪现曙光。
