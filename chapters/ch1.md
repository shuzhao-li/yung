CHAPTER I 
BOYHOOD 

I was born on the 17th of November, 1828, in 
the village of Nam Ping (South Screen) which 
is about four miles southwest of the Portuguese 
Colony of Macao, and is situated on Pedro 
Island lying west of Macao, from which it is 
separated by a channel of half a mile wide. 

I was one of a family of four children. A 
brother was the eldest, a sister came next, I was 
the third, and another brother was the fourth 
and the youngest of the group. I am the only 
survivor of them all. 

As early as 1834, an English lady, Mrs. 
Gutzlaff, wife of the Rev. Charles Gutzlaff, a 
missionary to China, came to Macao and, under 
the auspices of the Ladies' Association in 
London for the promotion of female education 
in India and the East, immediately took up the

work of her mission by starting a girls' school 
for Chinese girls, which was soon followed by the 
opening of a school for boys also. 

Mrs. GutzlafFs comprador or factotum hap- 
pened to come from the village I did and was, in 
fact, my father's friend and neighbor. It was 
through him that iny parents heard about Mrs. 
GutzlafFs school and it was doubtless through 
his influence and means that my father got me 
admitted into the school. It has always been a 
mystery to me why my parents should take it 
into their heads to put me into a foreign school, 
instead of a regular orthodox Confucian school, 
where my brother much older than myself was 
placed. Most assuredly such a step would have 
been more in play with Chinese public sentiment, 
taste, and the wants of the country at large, than 
to allow me to attend an English school ; more- 
over, a Chinese cult is the only avenue in 
China that leads to political preferment, influ- 
ence, power and wealth. I can only account for 
the departure thus taken on the theory that as 
foreign intercourse with China was just begin- 
ning to grow, my parents, anticipating that it 
might soon assume the proportions of a tidal 
wave, thought it worth while to take time by the 
forelock and put one of their sons to learning 



BOYHOOD 3 

English that he might become one of the advanced 
interpreters and have a more advantageous posi- 
tion from which to make his way into the business 
and diplomatic world. This I take to be the 
chief aim that influenced my parents to put 
me into Mrs. GutzlafFs Mission School. As to 
what other results or sequences it has eventually 
brought about in my subsequent life, they were 
entirely left to Him who has control of all our 
devising and planning, as they are governed by 
a complete system of divine laws of antecedents 
and consequents, or of cause and effect. 

In 1835, when I was barely seven years of age, 
my father took me to Macao. Upon reaching 
the school, I was brought before Mrs. Gutzlaff. 
She was the first English lady I had ever seen. 
On my untutored and unsophisticated mind she 
made a deep impression. If my memory serves 
me right, she was somewhat tall and well-built. 
She had prominent features which were strong 
and assertive; her eyes were of clear blue lustre, 
somewhat deep set. She had thin lips, supported 
by a square chin, both indicative of firmness 
and authority. She had flaxen hair and eyebrows 
somewhat heavy. Her features taken collectively 
indicated great determination and will power. 

As she came forward to welcome me in her 



4 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

long and full flowing white dress (the interview 
took place in the summer), surmounted by two 
large globe sleeves which were fashionable at 
the time and which lent her an exaggerated 
appearance, I remember most vividly I was no 
less puzzled than stunned. I actually trembled 
all over with fear at her imposing proportions 
having never in my life seen such a peculiar 
and odd fashion. I clung to my father in fear. 
Her kindly expression and sympathetic smiles 
found little appreciative response at the outset, 
as I stood half dazed at her personality and my 
new environment. For really, a new world had 
dawned on me. After a time, when my home- 
sickness was over and the novelty of my sur- 
roundings began gradually to wear away, she 
completely won me over through her kindness 
and sympathy. I began to look upon her more 
like a mother. She seemed to take a special 
interest in me; I suppose, because I was young 
and helpless, and away from my parents, besides 
being the youngest pupil in the school. She kept 
me among her girl pupils and did not allow me 
to mingle with what few boys there were at the 
time. 

There is one escapade that I can never 
forget! It happened during the first year in 



BOYHOOD 5 

the school, and was an attempt on my part to 
run away. I was shut up in the third story of 
the house, which had a wide open terrace on the 
top, the only place where the girls and myself 
played and found recreation. We were not 
allowed to go out of doors to play in the streets. 
The boy pupils had their quarters on the ground 
floor and had full liberty to go out for exercise. 
I used to envy them their freedom and smuggled 
down stairs to mingle with them in their sports 
after school hours. I felt ill at ease to be shut 
up with the girls all alone way up in the third 
story. I wanted to see something of the outside 
world. I occasionally stole down stairs and 
ventured out to the wharves around which were 
clustered a number of small ferry boats which 
had a peculiar fascination to my young fancy. 
To gain my freedom, I planned to run away. 
The girls were all much older than I was, and 
a few sympathized with me in my wild scheme; 
doubtless, from the same restlessness of being 
too closely cooped up. I told them of my plan. 
Six of the older ones fell in with me in the idea. 
I was to slip out of the house alone, go down to 
the wharf and engage a covered boat to take us 
all in. 
The next morning after our morning meal, 



6 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and while Mrs. Gutzlaff was off taking her 
breakfast, we stole out unbeknown to any one 
and crowded into the boat and started off in hot 
haste for the opposite shore of Pedro Island. I 
was to take the whole party to my home and 
from there the girls were to disperse to their 
respective villages. We were half way across 
the channel when, to my great consternation, I 
saw a boat chasing us, making fast time and 
gaining on us all the while. No promise of addi- 
tional pay was of any avail, because our two oars 
against their four made it impossible for us to 
win out; so our boatmen gave up the race 
at the waving of handkerchiefs in the other 
boat and the whole party was captured. Then 
came the punishment. We were marched 
through the whole school and placed in a row, 
standing on a long narrow school table placed 
at one end of the school room facing all the 
pupils in front of us. I was placed in the center 
of the row, with a tall foolscap mounted on my 
head, having three girls on the right and three 
on the left. I had pinned on my breast a large 
square placard bearing the inscription, "Head 
of the Runaways; 9 ' there we stood for a whole 
hour till school was dismissed. I never felt so 
humiliated in my life as I did when I was under- 



BOYHOOD 7 

going that ordeal. I felt completely crestfallen. 
Some of the mischievous fellows would extract a 
little fun out of this display by taking furtive 
glances and making wry faces at us. Mrs, 
Gutzlaff, in order to aggravate our punishment, 
had ordered ginger snaps and oranges to be dis- 
tributed among the other pupils right before us. 

Mrs. Gutzlaff's school, started in September, 
1835, was originally for girls only. Pending 
the organization and opening of the so-called 
"Morrison Education Society School," in the 
interval between 1835 and 1839, a department 
for boys was temporarily incorporated into her 
school, and part of the subscription fund belong- 
ing to the M. E. S. School was devoted to the 
maintenance of this one. 

'This accounts for my entrance into Mrs. 
Gutzlaff's School, as one of only two boys first 
admitted. Her school being thus enlarged and 
modified temporarily, Mrs. Gutzlaff's two nieces 
the Misses Parkes, sisters to Mr. Harry 
Parkes who was afterwards knighted, by reason 
of the conspicuous part he played in the second 
Opium War, in 1864, of which he was in fact 
the originator came out to China as assistants 
in the school. I was fortunately placed under 
their instruction for a short time.

Afterwards the boys' school tinder Mrs. 
Gutzlaff and her two nieces, the Misses Parkes, 
was broken up; that event parted our ways in 
life in divergent directions. Mrs. Gutzlaff went 
over to the United States with three blind girls, 
Laura, Lucy and Jessie, The Misses Parkes 
were married to missionaries, one to Dr. William 
Lockhart, a medical missionary; the other to a 
Rev. Mr. MacClatchy, also a missionary. They 
labored long in China, under the auspices of the 
London Missionary Society. The three blind 
girls whom Mrs. Gutzlaff took with her were 
taught by me to read on raised letters till they 
could read from the Bible and Pilgrim's 
Progress. 

On my return to my home village I resumed 
my Chinese studies. 

In the fall of 1840, while the Opium War was 
still going on, my father died, leaving four 
children on my mother's hands without means of 
support. 

Fortunately, three of us were old enough to 
lend a helping hand. My brother was engaged 
in fishing, my sister helped in housework, and I 
took to hawking candy through my own village 
and the neighboring one. I took hold of the busi- 
ness in good earnest, rising at three o'clock every 



BOYHOOD 9 

morning, and I did not come home until six 
o'clock in the evening. My daily earnings netted 
twenty-five cents, which I turned over to iny 
mother, and with the help given by my brother, 
who was the main stay of the family, we man- 
aged to keep the wolf away from our door. I 
was engaged in hawking candy for about five 
months, and when winter was over, when no 
candy was made, I changed my occupation and 
went into the rice fields to glean rice after the 
reapers. My sister usually accompanied me in 
such excursions. But unlike Ruth of old, I had 
no Boaz to help me out when I was short in my 
gleaning. But my knowledge of English came 
to my rescue. My sister told the head reaper 
that I could speak, read and write English. 
This awakened the curiosity of the reaper. He 
beckoned me to him and asked me whether I 
wouldn't talk some "Red Hair Men" talk to 
him. He said he never heard of such talk in his 
life. I felt bashful and diffident at first, but my 
sister encouraged me and said "the reaper may 
give you a large bundle of rice sheaf to take 
home." This was said as a kind of prompter. 
The reaper was shrewd enough to take it up, and 
told me that if I would talk, he would give me a 
bundle heavier than I could carry. So I began 



10 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and repeated the alphabet to him. All the reap- 
ers as well as the gleaners stood in vacant silence, 
with mouths wide open, grinning with evident 
delight. A few minutes after my maiden speech 
was delivered in the paddy field with water and 
mud almost knee deep, I was rewarded with 
several sheaves, and I had to hurry away in order 
to get two other boys to carry what my sister 
and I could not lug. Thus I came home loaded 
with joy and sheaves of golden rice to my 
mother, little dreaming that my smattering 
knowledge of English would serve me such a 
turn so early in my career. I was then about 
twelve years old. Even Ruth with her six 
measures of corn did not fare any better than I 
did. 

Soon after the gleaning days, all too few, were 
over, a neighbor of mine who was a printer in 
the printing office of a Roman Catholic priest 
happened to be home from Macao on a vacation. 
He spoke to my mother about the priest wanting 
to hire a boy in his office who knew enough 
English to read the numerals correctly, so as to 
be able to fold and prepare the papers for the 
binders. My mother said I could do the work. 
So I was introduced to the priest and a bargain 
was struck. I returned home to report myself, 



BOYHOOD II 

and a few days later I was in Macao and entered 
upon my duty as a folder on a salary of $4.50 
a month. My board and lodging came to $1.50 
the balance of $3.00 was punctually sent to 
my mother every month. I did not get rich 
quickly in this employment, for I had been there 
but four months when a call for me to quit work 
came from a quarter I least expected. It had 
more the sound of heaven in it. It came from a 
Dr. Benjamin Hobson, a medical missionary 
in Macao whose hospital was not more than a 
mile from the printer's office. He sent word 
that he wanted to see me; that he had been hunt- 
ing for me for months. I knew Dr. Hobson well, 
for I saw him a number of times at Mrs. Gutz- 
laffs. So I called on him. At the outset, I 
thought he was going to take me in to make a 
doctor of me, but no, he said he had a promise to 
fulfill. Mrs. Gutzlaff's last message to him, 
before she embarked for America with the three 
blind girls, was to be sure to find out where I 
was and to put me into the Morrison Education 
Society School as soon as it was opened for 
pupils. 

"This is what I wanted to see you for," said 
Dr. Hobson. "Before you leave your employ- 
ment and after you get the consent of your 



12 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

mother to let you go to the Morrison School, I 
would like to have you come to the hospital and 
stay with me for a short time so that I may 
become better acquainted with you, before I take 
you to the Morrison School, which is already 
opened for pupils, and introduce you to the 
teacher." 

At the end of the interview, I went home to 
see my mother who, after some reluctance, gave 
her consent. I returned to Macao, bade fare- 
well to the priest who, though reticent and 
reserved, not having said a word to me during 
all the four months I was in his employ, yet did 
not find fault with me in my work. I went over 
to the hospital. Dr. Hobson immediately set 
me to work with the mortar and pestle, prepar- 
ing materials for ointments and pills. I used to 
carry a tray and accompany him in his rounds 
to visit the patients, in the benevolent work of 
alleviating their pains and sufferings. I was 
with him about a couple of months in the hos- 
pital work, at the end of which time he took me 
one day and introduced me to the Rev. Samuel 
Robins Brown, the teacher of the Morrison 
Education Society School.
