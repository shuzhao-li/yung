CHAPTER I 
BOYHOOD 

I was born on the 17th of November, 1828, in 
the village of Nam Ping (South Screen) which 
is about four miles southwest of the Portuguese 
Colony of Macao, and is situated on Pedro 
Island lying west of Macao, from which it is 
separated by a channel of half a mile wide. 

I was one of a family of four children. A 
brother was the eldest, a sister came next, I was 
the third, and another brother was the fourth 
and the youngest of the group. I am the only 
survivor of them all. 

As early as 1834, an English lady, Mrs. 
Gutzlaff, wife of the Rev. Charles Gutzlaff, a 
missionary to China, came to Macao and, under 
the auspices of the Ladies' Association in 
London for the promotion of female education 
in India and the East, immediately took up the 
work of her mission by starting a girls' school 
for Chinese girls, which was soon followed by the 
opening of a school for boys also. 

Mrs. GutzlafFs comprador or factotum happened to 
come from the village I did and was, in 
fact, my father's friend and neighbor. It was 
through him that iny parents heard about Mrs. 
GutzlafFs school and it was doubtless through 
his influence and means that my father got me 
admitted into the school. It has always been a 
mystery to me why my parents should take it 
into their heads to put me into a foreign school, 
instead of a regular orthodox Confucian school, 
where my brother much older than myself was 
placed. Most assuredly such a step would have 
been more in play with Chinese public sentiment, 
taste, and the wants of the country at large, than 
to allow me to attend an English school; 
moreover, a Chinese cult is the only avenue in 
China that leads to political preferment, 
influence, power and wealth. I can only account for 
the departure thus taken on the theory that as 
foreign intercourse with China was just beginning 
to grow, my parents, anticipating that it 
might soon assume the proportions of a tidal 
wave, thought it worth while to take time by the 
forelock and put one of their sons to learning 
English that he might become one of the advanced 
interpreters and have a more advantageous position 
from which to make his way into the business 
and diplomatic world. This I take to be the 
chief aim that influenced my parents to put 
me into Mrs. GutzlafFs Mission School. As to 
what other results or sequences it has eventually 
brought about in my subsequent life, they were 
entirely left to Him who has control of all our 
devising and planning, as they are governed by 
a complete system of divine laws of antecedents 
and consequents, or of cause and effect. 

In 1835, when I was barely seven years of age, 
my father took me to Macao. Upon reaching 
the school, I was brought before Mrs. Gutzlaff. 
She was the first English lady I had ever seen. 
On my untutored and unsophisticated mind she 
made a deep impression. If my memory serves 
me right, she was somewhat tall and well-built. 
She had prominent features which were strong 
and assertive; her eyes were of clear blue lustre, 
somewhat deep set. She had thin lips, supported 
by a square chin, both indicative of firmness 
and authority. She had flaxen hair and eyebrows 
somewhat heavy. Her features taken collectively 
indicated great determination and will power. 

As she came forward to welcome me in her 
long and full flowing white dress (the interview 
took place in the summer), surmounted by two 
large globe sleeves which were fashionable at 
the time and which lent her an exaggerated 
appearance, I remember most vividly I was no 
less puzzled than stunned. I actually trembled 
all over with fear at her imposing proportions 
having never in my life seen such a peculiar 
and odd fashion. I clung to my father in fear. 
Her kindly expression and sympathetic smiles 
found little appreciative response at the outset, 
as I stood half dazed at her personality and my 
new environment. For really, a new world had 
dawned on me. After a time, when my homesickness 
was over and the novelty of my surroundings 
began gradually to wear away, she 
completely won me over through her kindness 
and sympathy. I began to look upon her more 
like a mother. She seemed to take a special 
interest in me; I suppose, because I was young 
and helpless, and away from my parents, besides 
being the youngest pupil in the school. She kept 
me among her girl pupils and did not allow me 
to mingle with what few boys there were at the 
time. 

There is one escapade that I can never 
forget! It happened during the first year in 
the school, and was an attempt on my part to 
run away. I was shut up in the third story of 
the house, which had a wide open terrace on the 
top, the only place where the girls and myself 
played and found recreation. We were not 
allowed to go out of doors to play in the streets. 
The boy pupils had their quarters on the ground 
floor and had full liberty to go out for exercise. 
I used to envy them their freedom and smuggled 
down stairs to mingle with them in their sports 
after school hours. I felt ill at ease to be shut 
up with the girls all alone way up in the third 
story. I wanted to see something of the outside 
world. I occasionally stole down stairs and 
ventured out to the wharves around which were 
clustered a number of small ferry boats which 
had a peculiar fascination to my young fancy. 
To gain my freedom, I planned to run away. 
The girls were all much older than I was, and 
a few sympathized with me in my wild scheme; 
doubtless, from the same restlessness of being 
too closely cooped up. I told them of my plan. 
Six of the older ones fell in with me in the idea. 
I was to slip out of the house alone, go down to 
the wharf and engage a covered boat to take us 
all in. 

The next morning after our morning meal, 
and while Mrs. Gutzlaff was off taking her 
breakfast, we stole out unbeknown to any one 
and crowded into the boat and started off in hot 
haste for the opposite shore of Pedro Island. I 
was to take the whole party to my home and 
from there the girls were to disperse to their 
respective villages. We were half way across 
the channel when, to my great consternation, I 
saw a boat chasing us, making fast time and 
gaining on us all the while. No promise of addi- 
tional pay was of any avail, because our two oars 
against their four made it impossible for us to 
win out; so our boatmen gave up the race 
at the waving of handkerchiefs in the other 
boat and the whole party was captured. Then 
came the punishment. We were marched 
through the whole school and placed in a row, 
standing on a long narrow school table placed 
at one end of the school room facing all the 
pupils in front of us. I was placed in the center 
of the row, with a tall foolscap mounted on my 
head, having three girls on the right and three 
on the left. I had pinned on my breast a large 
square placard bearing the inscription, "Head 
of the Runaways; there we stood for a whole 
hour till school was dismissed. I never felt so 
humiliated in my life as I did when I was undergoing 
that ordeal. I felt completely crestfallen. 
Some of the mischievous fellows would extract a 
little fun out of this display by taking furtive 
glances and making wry faces at us. Mrs. 
Gutzlaff, in order to aggravate our punishment, 
had ordered ginger snaps and oranges to be 
distributed among the other pupils right before us. 

Mrs. Gutzlaff's school, started in September, 
1835, was originally for girls only. Pending 
the organization and opening of the so-called 
"Morrison Education Society School," in the 
interval between 1835 and 1839, a department 
for boys was temporarily incorporated into her 
school, and part of the subscription fund 
belonging to the M. E. S. School was devoted to the 
maintenance of this one. 

This accounts for my entrance into Mrs. 
Gutzlaff's School, as one of only two boys first 
admitted. Her school being thus enlarged and 
modified temporarily, Mrs. Gutzlaff's two nieces 
the Misses Parkes, sisters to Mr. Harry 
Parkes who was afterwards knighted, by reason 
of the conspicuous part he played in the second 
Opium War, in 1864, of which he was in fact 
the originator came out to China as assistants 
in the school. I was fortunately placed under 
their instruction for a short time. 

Afterwards the boys' school tinder Mrs. 
Gutzlaff and her two nieces, the Misses Parkes, 
was broken up; that event parted our ways in 
life in divergent directions. Mrs. Gutzlaff went 
over to the United States with three blind girls, 
Laura, Lucy and Jessie, The Misses Parkes 
were married to missionaries, one to Dr. William 
Lockhart, a medical missionary; the other to a 
Rev. Mr. MacClatchy, also a missionary. They 
labored long in China, under the auspices of the 
London Missionary Society. The three blind 
girls whom Mrs. Gutzlaff took with her were 
taught by me to read on raised letters till they 
could read from the Bible and Pilgrim's 
Progress. 

On my return to my home village I resumed 
my Chinese studies. 

In the fall of 1840, while the Opium War was 
still going on, my father died, leaving four 
children on my mother's hands without means of 
support. 

Fortunately, three of us were old enough to 
lend a helping hand. My brother was engaged 
in fishing, my sister helped in housework, and I 
took to hawking candy through my own village 
and the neighboring one. I took hold of the business 
in good earnest, rising at three o'clock every 
morning, and I did not come home until six 
o'clock in the evening. My daily earnings netted 
twenty-five cents, which I turned over to iny 
mother, and with the help given by my brother, 
who was the main stay of the family, we managed 
to keep the wolf away from our door. I 
was engaged in hawking candy for about five 
months, and when winter was over, when no 
candy was made, I changed my occupation and 
went into the rice fields to glean rice after the 
reapers. My sister usually accompanied me in 
such excursions. But unlike Ruth of old, I had 
no Boaz to help me out when I was short in my 
gleaning. But my knowledge of English came 
to my rescue. My sister told the head reaper 
that I could speak, read and write English. 
This awakened the curiosity of the reaper. He 
beckoned me to him and asked me whether I 
wouldn't talk some "Red Hair Men" talk to 
him. He said he never heard of such talk in his 
life. I felt bashful and diffident at first, but my 
sister encouraged me and said "the reaper may 
give you a large bundle of rice sheaf to take 
home." This was said as a kind of prompter. 
The reaper was shrewd enough to take it up, and 
told me that if I would talk, he would give me a 
bundle heavier than I could carry. So I began 
and repeated the alphabet to him. All the reap- 
ers as well as the gleaners stood in vacant silence, 
with mouths wide open, grinning with evident 
delight. A few minutes after my maiden speech 
was delivered in the paddy field with water and 
mud almost knee deep, I was rewarded with 
several sheaves, and I had to hurry away in order 
to get two other boys to carry what my sister 
and I could not lug. Thus I came home loaded 
with joy and sheaves of golden rice to my 
mother, little dreaming that my smattering 
knowledge of English would serve me such a 
turn so early in my career. I was then about 
twelve years old. Even Ruth with her six 
measures of corn did not fare any better than I 
did. 

Soon after the gleaning days, all too few, were 
over, a neighbor of mine who was a printer in 
the printing office of a Roman Catholic priest 
happened to be home from Macao on a vacation. 
He spoke to my mother about the priest wanting 
to hire a boy in his office who knew enough 
English to read the numerals correctly, so as to 
be able to fold and prepare the papers for the 
binders. My mother said I could do the work. 
So I was introduced to the priest and a bargain 
was struck. I returned home to report myself, 
and a few days later I was in Macao and entered 
upon my duty as a folder on a salary of $4.50 
a month. My board and lodging came to $1.50 
the balance of $3.00 was punctually sent to 
my mother every month. I did not get rich 
quickly in this employment, for I had been there 
but four months when a call for me to quit work 
came from a quarter I least expected. It had 
more the sound of heaven in it. It came from a 
Dr. Benjamin Hobson, a medical missionary 
in Macao whose hospital was not more than a 
mile from the printer's office. He sent word 
that he wanted to see me; that he had been hunt- 
ing for me for months. I knew Dr. Hobson well, 
for I saw him a number of times at Mrs. Gutz- 
laffs. So I called on him. At the outset, I 
thought he was going to take me in to make a 
doctor of me, but no, he said he had a promise to 
fulfill. Mrs. Gutzlaff's last message to him, 
before she embarked for America with the three 
blind girls, was to be sure to find out where I 
was and to put me into the Morrison Education 
Society School as soon as it was opened for 
pupils. 

"This is what I wanted to see you for," said 
Dr. Hobson. "Before you leave your employ- 
ment and after you get the consent of your 
mother to let you go to the Morrison School, I 
would like to have you come to the hospital and 
stay with me for a short time so that I may 
become better acquainted with you, before I take 
you to the Morrison School, which is already 
opened for pupils, and introduce you to the 
teacher." 

At the end of the interview, I went home to 
see my mother who, after some reluctance, gave 
her consent. I returned to Macao, bade fare- 
well to the priest who, though reticent and 
reserved, not having said a word to me during 
all the four months I was in his employ, yet did 
not find fault with me in my work. I went over 
to the hospital. Dr. Hobson immediately set 
me to work with the mortar and pestle, prepar- 
ing materials for ointments and pills. I used to 
carry a tray and accompany him in his rounds 
to visit the patients, in the benevolent work of 
alleviating their pains and sufferings. I was 
with him about a couple of months in the hos- 
pital work, at the end of which time he took me 
one day and introduced me to the Rev. Samuel 
Robins Brown, the teacher of the Morrison 
Education Society School.

第一章 童年岁月

我于1828年11月17日出生在澳门西南四英里处的南屏村。这个村庄位于澳门西侧的卑多罗岛上，与澳门之间隔着半英里宽的海峡。

我家共有四个孩子。长兄之后是姐姐，我排行第三，下面还有个幼弟。如今我是兄弟姐妹中唯一的幸存者。

早在1834年，英国传教士郭士立牧师（Rev. Charles Gutzlaff）的夫人来到澳门。在伦敦妇女联合会的资助下——该会致力于推动印度与东方国家的女性教育——她立即创办了一所中文女塾，不久后又增设了男塾。

郭士立夫人的买办兼管家恰巧与我同乡，事实上他是我父亲的好友兼邻居。正是通过他，我父母得知了郭士立夫人的学堂。毫无疑问，在他的引荐和帮助下，父亲将我送入了这所学堂。我始终不解的是，为何父母会突发奇想让我就读洋学堂，而非当时兄长所入的传统儒家学塾。按常理，后者显然更符合中国社会的普遍观念、文化传统及国家需求，毕竟科举功名才是通向仕途显达、权势财富的唯一正途。唯一可能的解释是：随着中外交往初现端倪，父母预见这股浪潮将汹涌而至，认为有必要未雨绸缪，让一个孩子学习英文，将来成为高级通译，在外交商贸领域占据优势地位。这应该就是父母送我入郭士立夫人学堂的主要考量。至于这一决定将如何影响我的人生轨迹，则完全交由那位主宰世人筹谋的上苍来安排——毕竟万事都遵循着因果相生的神圣法则。

1835年，我刚满七岁时，父亲带我来到澳门。初见郭士立夫人，这位身着当时流行的膨袖白裙（时值夏季）的英国女士，给我这个懵懂孩童留下了深刻印象。若记忆无误，她身材高挑，轮廓分明：深邃的蓝眼睛，坚毅的薄唇与方颌，淡金色眉毛下透着不容置疑的威严。那身夸张的异国装束令我惊惧不已，紧紧拽着父亲不敢松手。尽管她和蔼可亲，初来乍到的我仍被这全新环境震慑得不知所措。待思乡之情渐淡，她的慈爱终使我卸下心防，视她如母。或许因我年纪最小又远离父母，她格外关照我，甚至让我与女生同处，禁止与其他男童往来。

有一桩逃学闹剧令我终生难忘。入学第一年，被禁锢在三楼天台（女生们唯一的游乐场）的我，艳羡着楼下男生的自由。某日我策划了一场逃亡：六名年长女生协助我租船，准备逃回卑多罗岛。不料中途被追兵截获。惩罚方式是：我们七人站在长桌上示众一小时，我头顶高帽胸挂"逃学首领"的牌子，眼睁睁看着其他学生分食姜饼蜜橘。这份屈辱令我刻骨铭心。

郭士立夫人最初于1835年9月创办女塾。在1835至1839年马礼逊教育会学堂筹备期间，该校临时增设男童部，并挪用部分教育会资金维持运转。这就是我作为首批两名男生之一入读的缘由。学校扩建期间，郭士立夫人的两位侄女——帕克斯姐妹（其兄弟哈利·帕克斯爵士在第二次鸦片战争中扮演重要角色）来校任教，我有幸短期受教于她们。

后来男塾解散，众人各奔前程：郭士立夫人携三位盲女赴美（我曾教她们摸读凸字版《圣经》与《天路历程》）；帕克斯姐妹分别嫁给了伦敦会的医疗传教士雒魏林博士（Dr. William Lockhart）与麦嘉谛牧师（Rev. Mr. MacClatchy）。

回到家乡后，我重拾四书五经。1840年秋鸦片战争期间，父亲猝然离世，留下母亲与我们四个孩子艰难度日。年长的兄姊各司其职：兄长捕鱼，姐姐理家，而我则开始走街串巷叫卖糖果。每日凌晨三点开工，日赚二角五分补贴家用。冬季转作田间拾穗者时，我的英文竟意外派上用场——为满足收割头领的好奇心，我背诵字母表换来沉甸甸的稻束，需另雇两名男童才能运回。那年我十二岁，恍如《路得记》的现代翻版，却无波阿斯的眷顾。

拾穗季结束后，一位在澳门天主教印刷所工作的同乡返乡探亲。得知神父需要懂英文数字的折页工后，母亲立即推荐了我。我在澳门以月薪四元五角就职，每月寄回三元养家。四个月后，命运再次转折：医疗传教士合信医生（Dr. Benjamin Hobson）寻访多时，要兑现郭士立夫人的嘱托——送我去新开办的马礼逊学堂就读。在短暂医院见习（学习捣药配剂）后，1841年，他引荐我见到了学堂创始人布朗牧师（Rev. Samuel Robins Brown），从此开启新的人生篇章。

第一章
童年时代

我出生于1828年11月17日，地点是南屏村，距离葡萄牙殖民地澳门西南约四英里。南屏位于澳门以西的白鴿巢岛（又称九澳岛）上，与澳门之间隔着半英里宽的海峡。

我家共有四个孩子。我有一个哥哥，是长子；其次是一个姐姐；我排行第三；还有一个弟弟，是我们中最小的。如今，四人中唯有我一人尚在世。

早在1834年，一位英国女士古士励夫人（Mrs. Gutzlaff）——她是传教士古士励牧师（Rev. Charles Gutzlaff）的妻子——来到澳门，并受伦敦“印度及东方女子教育促进会”的委托，开始她的传教工作，开办了一所招收中国女孩的女子学校。不久之后，她又开办了一所男童学校。

古士励夫人的买办（即管家或办事人）恰巧与我来自同一个村庄，实际上还是我父亲的朋友和邻居。正是通过他，我的父母得知了古士励夫人的学校，也很可能是他出面帮忙，我父亲才得以让我入学。这件事我一直感到很不可思议——父母为何不把我送去正规的儒家学堂（我的哥哥就在那里读书），反而让我进了一所洋人的学校？毫无疑问，送我去读儒学才更符合中国社会的期待、传统的观念和国家的需要；而且，在中国，只有精通儒学之道才能走上仕途，获取权力与财富。我唯一能想到的解释是：由于中外交往正处于初期阶段，我的父母或许预见到这股潮流日后会迅猛发展，于是抢在别人前头，让一个孩子学习英文，希望他将来能成为先进的通事（翻译官），在商界或外交领域占据有利地位。我认为，这就是他们送我去古士励夫人学校的主要原因。至于此举后来对我一生产生了哪些影响，那就只能交由掌控我们一切计划与安排的上苍了；因为人生之路终究遵循因果律的安排，受制于一套完善的神圣法则。

1835年，我年仅七岁时，父亲带我来到澳门。到了学校，我被带到古士励夫人面前。她是我生平所见的第一位英国女士。在我这个懵懂、未经世事的孩子心中，她留下了极深的印象。如果我记得不错，她身材颇高，体态匀称，五官立体分明，带着一种坚定与威严；她的眼睛是明亮的蓝色，稍微有些深陷；嘴唇较薄，下巴方正，二者都显出她的坚毅与权威。她是一头亚麻色头发，眉毛浓密。从整体看，她的容貌透露出强烈的意志力。

她穿着一袭白色长裙（那是夏天），衣袖是当时流行的灯笼袖，显得格外庞大。当她迎面走来时，我惊讶得几乎要呆住了。我从未见过如此奇特的装扮，吓得浑身发抖，紧紧抓住父亲的手。她脸上满是慈爱与笑容，但我起初却无法感受到她的亲切，我只是茫然站着，被眼前的人与环境惊得无所适从。那一刻，对我来说，仿佛进入了一个全新的世界。然而，过了一段时间，我克服了思乡情绪，对新环境也渐渐习惯了，古士励夫人的善良与体贴完全征服了我。我开始把她视作一位母亲。她似乎特别关心我，或许因为我年纪小、离开了父母、又是全校最小的学生。她让我待在女生中间，不准我和为数不多的男生在一起玩耍。

有一件事我永远不会忘记！那是在入学第一年，我曾试图逃跑。我被安排住在三楼，那是全屋最高层，屋顶有一个开阔的平台，是女生和我玩耍的唯一场所。我们不允许出门上街玩耍。而男生则住在底层，可以随意出门活动。我常常羡慕他们的自由，偷偷下楼在课余时间与他们玩耍。我很不适应和一群女孩单独待在三楼。我渴望看看外面的世界。有时候我偷偷溜出门，来到码头，那里停着许多小小的渡船，它们对我这个年幼的孩子充满了诱惑。我计划逃走，重获自由。女孩子们年龄都比我大，其中几位对我的疯狂计划表示同情，可能也是因为被困太久感到烦闷。我告诉她们我的计划，有六位年长的女生加入了我。我计划先一个人溜出校门，到码头找一艘有篷的船，再回来接她们上船。

第二天早饭后，趁古士励夫人去吃早餐，我们悄悄逃出校门，挤进小船，急忙驶向对岸的白鸽巢岛。我打算先带她们去我家，然后她们各自返回自己所在的村庄。可当我们行至半途时，我惊恐地发现一艘船正飞速追赶我们，距离越来越近。无论我怎么承诺给船夫额外酬劳都无济于事，因为我们只有两支桨，而对方有四支，我们根本无力逃脱。对方挥舞着手帕示意，船夫只得放弃逃跑。我们全体被擒。接着便是惩罚。我们被带回学校，当众羞辱，站在教室讲台前的一张狭长课桌上，面向所有学生。我站在中间，头上戴着高帽，帽子上写着“逃学头目”，左右各站三位女生，胸前挂着一块大牌子。我们就那样站了整整一小时，直到放学。我一生中从未有过如此羞辱的经历。我感到彻底沮丧。有些调皮男生偷偷看我们，做些鬼脸取笑。古士励夫人为加重我们的惩罚，还特地在我们面前分发姜饼和橙子给其他学生。

古士励夫人的学校创办于1835年9月，原为女子学校。由于“马礼逊教育会学校”（Morrison Education Society School）尚未开办，在1835至1839年期间，古士励夫人暂时设立了男童部，并将马礼逊学校部分资助用于维持这所混合学校。

因此，我成了古士励夫人学校最初录取的两名男生之一。学校扩展之后，古士励夫人的两个外甥女帕克斯小姐（Misses Parkes）姐妹加入担任教师，她们的弟弟哈里·帕克斯（Mr. Harry Parkes）后来在第二次鸦片战争中表现突出，被封为爵士。我幸运地曾受她们短期教导。

之后，男童部解散，我与古士励夫人、帕克斯小姐的人生从此分道扬镳。古士励夫人带着三位盲女（劳拉、露西、杰茜）赴美。帕克斯姐妹嫁给了传教士，一位嫁给医学传教士罗克赫特医生（Dr. William Lockhart），另一位嫁给牧师麦克克拉奇（Rev. Mr. MacClatchy），她们都在“伦敦传道会”旗下长期在华工作。而我曾教那三位盲女用凸字读书，最终能读《圣经》和《天路历程》。

我回到家乡后，继续学习中文。

1840年秋，鸦片战争仍在进行，我父亲去世，留下母亲独自抚养四个孩子，无以为继。

所幸我们有三人已可自力更生。我哥哥去捕鱼，姐姐操持家务，我则挑着糖果走村串巷叫卖。我每天凌晨三点起床，晚上六点才回家，每天可挣两毛五分钱，全交给母亲。哥哥是家中主要经济支柱，我们就这样勉强维持生活。我卖糖果大约五个月，等冬季过去糖不再制作，我转而下田拾稻穗，姐姐常陪我一同前往。但我不像《圣经》中的路得那样幸运，没人像波阿斯一样施以援手。但我的英文知识救了我一命。姐姐告诉主割者我会读写英文，这激起了他的好奇。他让我给他说几句“红毛鬼”的话（意指洋人话）。我起初害羞，姐姐鼓励我，说不定他说得对，会给我一大把稻子。主割者果然说，如果我肯说，他就给我一个我背不动的稻捆。我便念起了英文字母，众人围观，听得目瞪口呆。几分钟后，我获得几大把稻穗，还得请两个小伙伴帮忙背回家。那时我才十二岁，收获喜悦满满，回到母亲身边。那是我第一次意识到，原来我那点微薄的英语知识，竟然能在关键时刻帮我渡过难关。就连路得收的六斗大麦，也不比我这次收获更丰盛。

不久，拾穗的日子结束了。我家一位邻居是澳门一位天主教神父的印刷工人，回乡度假。他告诉母亲，那位神父正在找一位懂点英文、会认数字的小孩，在印刷厂里折叠纸张、送去装订。母亲说我可以胜任。于是我被介绍给神父，谈妥条件。我返回澳门，在印刷厂工作，每月薪水四元五角，住宿伙食费一元五角，剩下三元全数寄给母亲。这份工作虽不致富，但却稳定。谁知才干了四个月，就突然有人找我，出乎意料。这次找我的是本杰明·合信医生（Dr. Benjamin Hobson），他是澳门的医学传教士，诊所距离印刷厂不远。他说找我找了好久。我认识他，曾在古士励夫人家见过他。他告诉我，这次找我是因为他答应了古士励夫人的临行托付——她带盲女赴美前，特别嘱咐他，一定要找到我，送我去马礼逊教育会学校就读。

“这就是我找你的原因，”合信医生说，“但在你辞职之前，也征得你母亲同意之后，我希望你先来医院住一段时间，让我多了解你，然后再送你去马礼逊学校，学校已经开学了，我会介绍你给老师认识。”

谈话结束后，我回家征求母亲意见，她起初犹豫，最终还是同意了。我回到澳门，辞别那位沉默寡言但不曾责备我的神父，前往医院。合信医生马上让我动手捣药，为病人制药。我还会端着托盘跟他一起查房，为病人减轻痛苦。我在医院待了两个月左右，直到有一天他带我去见了马礼逊教育会学校的老师，布朗牧师（Rev. Samuel Robins Brown）。
