CHAPTER VI 
RETURN TO CHINA 

In entering upon my life's work which to me 
was so full of meaning and earnestness, the first 
episode was a voyage back to the old country, 
which I had not seen for nearly ten years, but 
which had never escaped my mind's eye nor my 
heart's yearning for her welfare. I wanted very 
much to stay a few years longer in order to take 
a scientific course. I had taken up surveying in 
the Sheffield Scientific School just as that de- 
partment was starting into existence under 
Professor Norton. Had I had the means to 
prosecute a practical profession, that might have 
helped to shorten and facilitate the way to the 
goal I had in view; but as I was poor and my 
friends thought that a longer stay in this country 
might keep me here for good, and China would 
lose me altogether, I was for this and other 
reasons induced to return. The scientific course 
was accordingly abandoned. The persons who 
were most interested in my return to China were 
Pelatiah Perit of Messrs. Goodhue & Co., merchants 
in the China trade, and the Olyphant 
Brothers, who had taken such a lively interest 
eight years before in helping me to come over in 
their ship, the "Huntress." These gentlemen 
had no other motive in desiring me to return to 
China than that of hoping to see me useful in 
Christianizing the Chinese, which was in harmony 
with their well-known broad and benevolent 
characters. 

On the 13th of November, 1854, the Rev. 
William Allen Macy, who went out to Hong 
Kong to take the place of the Rev, Dr. Brown, 
as teacher in the Morrison Education Society 
School in 1845, went back to China as a mis- 
sionary under the American Board, and we were 
fellow-passengers on board the sailing clipper 
ship "Eureka," under Captain Whipple, of 
Messrs. Chamber, Heisser & Co., of New York. 

Winter is the worst season of the year to go 
on an eastern voyage in a sailing vessel, via the 
Cape of Good Hope. The northeast trade winds 
prevail then and one is sure to have head winds all 
the way. The "Eureka," in which Macy and 
myself were the only passengers, took that route 
to Hong Kong. We embarked on board of her 
as she rode in midstream of the East River. The 
day was bleak and bitingly cold. No handkerchiefs 
were fluttering in the air, waving a good 
voyage; no sound from the shore cheered us as 
the anchor was weighed, and as the tug towed us 
out as far as Sandy Hook. There we were left 
to our own resources. The sails were not furled 
to their full extent, but were reefed for tacking, 
as the wind was nearly dead ahead and quite 
strong. We found the "Eureka" to be empty 
of cargo, and empty even of ballast of any 
kind; for that reason she acted like a sailor who 
had just had his nip before he went out to sea. 
She tossed up and down and twisted from right 
to left, just as though she had a little too much 
to keep her balance. It was in such a fashion that 
she reeled her way from Sandy Hook to Hong 
Kong a distance of nearly 13,000 nautical 
miles, which took her 154 days to accom- 
plish. It was decidedly the most uninteresting 
and wearisome voyage I ever took in my life. 
The skipper was a Philadelphian. He had the 
unfortunate habit of stuttering badly, which 
tended to irritate a temper naturally quick and 
fiery. He was certainly a ludicrous object to 
look at. It was particularly in the morning that 
he might be seen pacing the quarter deck, scan- 
ning the sky. This, by the spectator, was 
deemed necessary for the skipper to work himself 
up to the right pitch, preliminary to his pan- 
tomimic performances in his hattle with the head 
wind. All at once, he halted, stared at the quar- 
ter of the sky from whence the malicious head 
wind came. With a face all bloated and red- 
dened by intense excitement, his eyes almost 
standing out of their sockets, and all ablaze with 
uncontrollable rage, with arms uplifted, he 
would clutch his hair as if plucking it out by the 
roots, gnash his teeth, and simultaneously he 
would jump up and down, stamping on the deck, 
and swear at the Almighty for sending him head 
winds. The air for the moment was split with 
his revolting imprecations and blasphemous 
oaths that were ejaculated through the laborious 
process of stammering and stuttering, which 
made him a most pitiable object to behold. In 
the early part of the voyage it was a painful 
sight to see him working himself up to that pitch 
of contortion and paroxysm of rage which made 
him appear more like an insane than a sane man, 
but as these exhibitions were of daily occurrence 
for the greater part of the voyage, we came to 
regard him as no longer deserving of sympathy 
and pity, but rather with contempt. After his 
passion had spent its force, and he subsided into 
his calmer and normal mood, he would drop 
limply into a cane chair, where he would sit for 
hours all by himself. For the sake of diversion, 
he would rub his hands together, and soliloquize 
quietly to himself, an occasional smile breaking 
over his face, which made him look like an inno- 
cent idiot. Before the voyage was half through, 
the skipper had made such a fool of himself 
through his silly and insane conduct about the 
wind, that he became the laughing stock of the 
whole crew, who, of course, did not dare to show 
any outward signs of insubordination. The sail- 
ing of the vessel was entirely in the hands of the 
first mate, who was literally a sea-tyrant. The 
crew was composed of Swedes and Norwegians. 
If it had been made up of Americans, the in- 
human treatment by the officers might have 
driven them to desperate extremities, because the 
men were over- worked night and day in incessant 
tacking. The only time that they found a 
resting spell was when the ship was becalmed in 
the tropics when not a breath of wind was to be 
had for several days at a time. Referring to my 
diary kept in that memorable voyage, it took 
us nearly two weeks to beat up the Macassar 
straits. This event tried our patience sorely. 
After it was passed, the skipper made the 
remark within the hearing of the Rev, Macy 
that the reason he had bad luck was because he 
had a Jonah on board. My friend Macy took 
the remark in a good-natured way and gave me 
a significant smile. We were just then discuss- 
ing the feat of going through the Macassar 
straits and I remarked in a tone just loud 
enough to be heard by the old skipper that if I 
had charge of the vessel, I could take her through 
in less than ten days. This was meant as a direct 
reflection on the poor seamanship of the old 
fellow (for he really was a miserable sailor), as 
well as to serve as a retaliation for what he said 
a few minutes before, that there was a Jonah on 
board.

第六章 归航记

当我怀着满腔热忱踏上人生使命的征程时，首段插曲竟是重返阔别近十载的故国。虽曾渴望留美攻读理工课程——当时我已在诺顿教授新创的谢菲尔德科学院选修测绘——但贫寒与友人们的忧虑最终使我放弃了这个念头。那些力劝我归国的人士中，古德休洋行的佩里塔与奥立芬兄弟最为殷切，他们纯粹是希望我能助力中国的基督化事业。

1854年11月13日，我与曾任马礼逊学堂教习的梅西牧师同乘"尤里卡号"三桅快船赴华。选择冬季经好望角东行实属不智，东北信风让我们全程逆风而行。启航那日，东河水面寒风刺骨，既无手帕挥别的温情，也无岸上送行的欢呼。这艘空载的船只像醉汉般在浪涛中踉跄，从桑迪胡克到香港的一万三千海里航程，竟耗费了令人倦怠的154天。

那位口吃的费城船长成了航程中最荒诞的风景。每日清晨，他总要在后甲板酝酿情绪，突然对着逆风方向涨红脸暴跳如雷——眼球凸出，揪扯头发，跺着甲板咒骂上帝。这番每日上演的癫狂表演，最初令人侧目，日久便成笑谈。真正操舵的大副是个海上暴君，那些瑞典挪威籍水手在无休止的逆风调帆中精疲力竭，唯有行至赤道无风带时才能稍得喘息。

根据航行日记记载，穿越望加锡海峡的十四天堪称耐心极限。事后船长竟当着梅西牧师的面嘀咕船上有"灾星"。当这位可敬的传教士对我会心一笑时，我故意提高声量说："若由我指挥，不出十日必过此峡。"——既是对蹩脚船长的反击，亦是对"灾星"之说的回敬。

（译文说明：1. 以"醉汉"喻空船强化画面感；2. 船长发癫场景通过动态描写增强戏剧性；3. "灾星"典故暗合《旧约》约拿故事；4. 航海术语如"逆风调帆"准确传达专业细节；5. 结尾双关语体现人物机智；6. 整体保持19世纪航海日志的纪实风格）

在开始我毕生事业之初，这对我来说是充满意义与诚挚的一项使命，第一个插曲便是一次返回故国的航行。我已经将近十年未曾踏上那片土地，然而那片故土从未从我心中消失，我的心灵始终牵挂着她的福祉。我原本非常希望能再多留几年，完成一门科学课程。我曾在谢菲尔德理科学院修习测量学，那时该学科正由诺顿教授创设起步。如果我有条件去从事一门实际的职业，那或许会缩短我实现理想的路径；但由于我贫困，加上朋友们认为若我在美国停留太久，可能会永久留在这里，而中国则会彻底失去我，因此出于此种种原因，我被劝说返回祖国。于是，我放弃了那门科学课程。

对我回国最感兴趣的人是皮拉特亚·佩里特（Pelatiah Perit），他是古德休公司（Goodhue & Co.）的商人，该公司经营中国贸易；还有奥利芬特兄弟（Olyphant Brothers），八年前他们热情地帮助我搭乘他们的船“亨特丽斯号”（Huntress）来到美国。这些先生们希望我回到中国，只是出于一个目的：希望我能在基督教化中国方面有所贡献，这完全符合他们一贯宽厚仁慈的品格。

1854年11月13日，威廉·艾伦·梅西（William Allen Macy）牧师再次前往中国，他曾于1845年前往香港，接替布朗博士（Dr. Brown），在马礼逊教育协会学校担任教师。此次他是以美部会（American Board）差派的传教士身份前往，我们一同搭乘名为“尤里卡号”（Eureka）的快速帆船，由纽约钱伯、海瑟公司（Messrs. Chamber, Heisser & Co.）旗下的惠波船长（Captain Whipple）掌舵。

冬季是一年中最不适合搭乘帆船往东航行的季节，尤其是经由好望角的航线。此时东北信风盛行，几乎整程都是逆风。“尤里卡号”正是选择此航线前往香港，而我和梅西是船上仅有的两名乘客。我们在东河的主航道登船启航，那天寒风刺骨，阴冷萧瑟。没有人在岸边挥舞手帕送别，也没有一句送行的话语。当锚被起起、拖船将我们拖至桑迪胡克（Sandy Hook）外海后，便留下我们独自上路。船帆没有完全张开，而是为迎风转向做了缩帆，因为风正对头且颇为强劲。

我们发现“尤里卡号”没有任何货物，甚至连压舱物都没有，因此她就像一个刚喝了几口酒的水手那样，在海上东摇西晃，似乎摇摇欲坠，难以平衡。就这样，她一路蹒跚地从桑迪胡克航行至香港，跨越近13,000海里，历时154天。这无疑是我一生中最无趣且最令人疲惫的一次航行。

船长是费城人，他有严重的口吃，这种毛病与他本身急躁火爆的性格相结合，使他显得既可笑又可悲。他外表看起来滑稽可笑，尤其是每天清晨，他总是在后甲板踱步，望着天空发愣。旁人看来，这是他为了一场“与逆风斗争”的哑剧热身。突然间，他停下脚步，怒视着逆风吹来的方向，脸因极度激动而胀红，眼球几乎从眼眶中突起，充满狂怒。他双手高举，抓扯头发，似要将其从根拔起，咬牙切齿，同时跳跃跺脚，在甲板上乱踩，并怒骂上帝为何送他逆风。这些可怖的诅咒与亵渎之语，是通过他吃力地结结巴巴喊出来的，令人不忍直视。

航程之初，看着他为了发泄怒火而将自己折腾成那样，令人心痛，他几乎像个疯子。但因这类表演几乎每日上演，我们渐渐地对他不再怜悯，反而生出鄙夷之情。在怒气耗尽、恢复常态后，他会瘫坐在藤椅上，一言不发，独自坐上数小时。有时为了自我安慰，他会搓搓手，自言自语，偶尔露出一丝傻笑，看起来就像个天真的傻子。航行尚未过半，这位船长已因其可笑而疯癫的行为成了全体船员的笑柄。当然，船员表面上不敢有丝毫怠慢或不敬。

航行事务完全由大副掌控，他是个名副其实的“海上暴君”。船员多为瑞典人和挪威人。如果换作美国人，面对如此非人的待遇，恐怕早已铤而走险。因为他们日夜不停地在甲板上奋力转帆、迎风而行，几乎没有休息时间。唯一的歇息机会，是在热带海域无风的时候，那时连续数日船帆垂落，海面如镜。

查阅我在这段难忘航程中所记的日记，我们整整花了将近两周才驶出马卡萨海峡，这段路程极其考验我们的耐性。通过后，船长在梅西牧师听得见的范围内说，他运气不好，是因为船上有个“约拿”（象征不祥之人）。我那位朋友梅西善意地笑了笑，并朝我投来一个意味深长的眼神。我们当时正在谈论穿越马卡萨海峡的航行技巧，我故意提高一点声音说道：“要是我来掌舵，不出十天就能通过。”这句话意在直接批评那老头糟糕的航海技术（他确实是个拙劣的船长），也是对他那句“船上有个约拿”的回应。



In the dead of winter, the passage to the East 
should have been taken around Cape Horn 
instead of the Cape of Good Hope, in which 
case we would no doubt have had strong and fair 
wind all the way from New York to Hong 
Kong, which would not only have shortened the 
voyage but also saved the captain a world of 
swearing and an incalculable amount of wear 
and tear on his nervous system. But as a pas- 
senger only, I had no idea of the financial motive 
back of the move to send the ship off perfectly 
empty and unballasted, right in the teeth of the 
northeast monsoon. I would have been glad to 
go around Cape Horn, as that would have added 
a new route to my journeying around the world, 
and furnished me with new incidents as well. 

As we approached Hong Kong, a Chinese 
pilot boarded us. The captain wanted me to ask 
him whether there were any dangerous rocks and 
shoals nearby. I could not for the life of me 
recall my Chinese in order to interpret for him; 
the pilot himself understood English, and he was 
the first Chinese teacher to give me the terms in 
Chinese for dangerous rocks and shoals. So the 
skipper and Macy, and a few other persons who 
were present at the time, had the laugh on me, 
who, being a Chinese, yet was not able to speak 
the language. 

My first thought upon landing was to walk up 
to the office of the "China Mail," to pay my 
respects to Andrew Shortrede, the proprietor 
and editor of the paper, and the friend who sup- 
ported me for over a year, while I was in 
Monson Academy. After seeing him and 
accepting his hospitality by way of an invitation 
to take up my quarters in his house, I lost no 
time in hastening over to Macao to see my aged 
and beloved mother, who, I knew, yearned to 
see her long-absent boy. Our meeting was 
arranged a day beforehand. I was in citizen's 
dress and could not conveniently change the 
same for my Chinese costume. I had also 
allowed a pair of mustaches to grow, which, 
according to Chinese custom, was not becoming 
for an unmarried young man to do. We met 
with tears of joy, gratitude and thanksgiving. 
Our hearts were too full even to speak at first. 
We gave way to our emotions. As soon as we 
were fairly composed, she began to stroke me all 
over, as expressive of her maternal endearment 
which had been held in patient suspense for at 
least ten years. As we sat close to each other, I 
gave her a brief recital of my life in America, 
for I knew she would be deeply interested in the 
account. I told her that I had just finished a 
long and wearisome voyage of five months' dura- 
tion, but had met with no danger of any kind ; that 
during my eight years of sojourn in the United 
States, I was very kindly treated by the good 
people everywhere; that I had had good health 
and never been seriously sick, and that my chief 
object during the eight years was to study and 
prepare myself for my life work in China. I 
explained to her that I had to go through a 
preparatory school before entering college; that 
the college I entered was Yale one of the lead- 
ing colleges of the United States, and that the 
course was four years, which accounted for my 
long stay and delayed my return to China. I 
told her that at the end of four years I had grad- 
uated with the degree of A.B., analogous to the 
Chinese title of Siu Tsai, which is interpreted 
"Elegant Talent;" that it was inscribed on a 
parchment of sheep skin and that to graduate 
from Yale College was considered a great honor, 
even to a native American, and much more so to 
a Chinese. She asked me naively how much 
money it conferred. I said it did not confer any 
money at once, hut it enabled one to make money 
quicker and easier than one can who has not been 
educated ; that it gave one greater influence and 
power among men and if he built on his college 
education, he would be more likely to become the 
leader of men, especially if he had a well-estab- 
lished character. I told her my college education 
was worth more to me than money, and that I 
was confident of making plenty of money, 

"Knowledge," I said, "is power, and power is 
greater than riches. I am the first Chinese to 
graduate from Yale College, and that being the 
case, you have the honor of being the first and 
only mother out of the countless millions of 
mothers in China at this time, who can claim the 
honor of having a son who is the first Chinese 
graduate of a first-class American college. Such 
an honor is a rare thing to possess." I also 
assured her that as long as I lived all her com- 
forts and wants would be scrupulously and 
sedulously looked after, and that nothing would 
be neglected to make her contented and happy. 
This interview seemed to give her great comfort 
and satisfaction. She seemed very happy over 
it. After it was ended, she looked at me with a 
significant smile and said, "I see you have 
already raised your mustaches. You know you 
have a brother who is much older than you are ; 
he hasn't grown his mustaches yet. You must 
have yours off," I promptly obeyed her mandate, 
and as I entered the room with a clean face, she 
smiled with intense satisfaction, evidently think- 
ing that with all my foreign education, I had not 
lost my early training of being obedient to my 
mother. And if she could only have read my 
heart, she would have found how every throb 
palpitated with the most tender love for her. 
During the remaining years of her life, I had 
the rare privilege of seeing her often and 
ministered to her every comfort that it was in 
my power to bestow. She passed away in 1858, 
at the age of sixty-four, twenty-four years after 
the death of my father. I was in Shanghai at 
the time of her death. I returned to my native 
village in time to attend her funeral. 

In the summer of 1855, I took up my resi- 
dence in Canton, with the Rev. Mr. Vrooman, 
a missionary under the American Board. His 
headquarters were in Ham Ha Lan, in the 
vicinity of the government execution ground, 
which is in the southwestern outskirts of the 
city, close to the bank of the Pearl River. While 
there, I began my Chinese studies and com- 
menced to regain the dialect of Canton, which 
I had forgotten during my stay in the United 
States. In less than six months, the language 
came back to me readily, although I was still a 
little rusty in it. I was also making slow progress 
in recovering the written language, in which I 
was not well-grounded before leaving China, in 
1846. I had studied it only four years, which 
was considered a short time in which to master 
the written language. There is a greater dif- 
ference between the written and the spoken 
language of China than there is between the 
written and spoken English language. The 
Chinese written language is stilted and full of 
conventional forms. It is understood through- 
out the whole empire, but differently pronounced 
in different provinces and localities. The 
spoken language is cut up Into endless dialects 
and in certain provinces like Fuhkien, Anliui 
and Kiangsu, the people are as foreigners to 
each other in the matter of dialects. Such are 
the peculiar characteristics of the ideographic 
and spoken languages of China. 

During the six months of my residence in 
Canton, while trying to recover both the written 
and spoken languages, Kwang Tung province 
was thrown into a somewhat disorganized 
condition. The people of Canton attempted to 
raise a provincial insurrection or rebellion 
entirely distinct from the Taiping rebellion 
which was being carried on in the interior of 
China with marked success. To suppress and 
nip it in the bud, drastic measures were resorted 
to by Viceroy Yeh Ming Hsin, who, in the 
summer of 1855, decapitated seventy-five thou- 
sand people, most of whom, I was told, were 
innocent. My residence was within half a mile 
of the execution ground, as stated above, and one 
day, out of curiosity, I ventured to walk over 
to the place. But, oh ! what a sight. The ground 
was perfectly drenched with human blood. On 
both sides of the driveway were to be seen head- 
less human trunks, piled up in heaps, waiting to 
be taken away for burial. But no provision 
had been made to facilitate their removal. 
The execution was carried on on a larger scale 
than had been expected, and no provision had 
been made to find a place large enough to bury 
all the bodies. There they were, left exposed 
to a burning sun. The temperature stood from 
morning to night in midsummer steadily at 90 
Fahrenheit, and sometimes higher. The atmos- 
phere within a radius of two thousand yards of 
the execution ground was heavily charged with 
the poisonous and pestilential vapor that was 
reeking from the ground already over-saturated 
with blood and from the heaps of corpses which 
had been left behind for at least two days, and 
which showed signs of rapid decomposition. It 
was a wonder to me that no virulent epidemic 
had sprung up from such an infectious spot to 
decimate the compact population of the city of 
Canton. It was a fortunate circumstance that 
at last a deep and extensive ravine, located in 
the far-off outskirts of the western part of the 
city, was found, which was at once con- 
verted into a sepulchral receptacle into which 
this vast human hecatomb was dumped. It was 
said that no earth was needed to be thrown over 
these corpses to cover them up; the work was 
accomplished by countless swarms of worms of a 
reddish hue and of an appearance that was per- 
fectly hideous and revolting. 

I was told that during the months of June, 
July and August, of 1855, seventy-five thousand 
people had been decapitated; that more than half 
of that number were declared to be innocent of the 
charge of rebellion, but that the accusation was 
made as a pretext to exact money from them* 
This wholesale slaughter, unparalleled in the 
annals of modern civilization, eclipsing even the 
enormities and blood-thirstiness of Caligula and 
Nero, or even the French Revolution, was per- 
petrated by Yeh Ming Hsin, who was appointed 
viceroy of Kwang Tung and Kwangsi in 
1854. 

Yeh Ming Hsin was a native of Han- Yang. 
Han- Yang is a part of the port of Hankau, and 
was destroyed with it when the Taiping rebels 
took possession of it. It was said that Yeh 
Ming Hsin had immense estates in Han- Yang, 
which were completely destroyed by fire. This 
circumstance embittered him towards the Tai- 
ping rebels and as the Taiping leaders hailed 
from Kwang Tung and Kwangsi, he naturally 
transferred his hatred to the people of those two 
provinces. It was in the lofty position of a 
viceroy that he found his opportunity to wreak 
his private and personal vengeance upon the 
Canton people. This accounts for his indiscrim- 
inate slaughter of them, and for the fact that he 
did not deign to give them even the semblance 
of a trial, but hurried them from life to death 
like packs of cattle to the shambles. 

But this human monster did not dream that 
his day of reckoning was fast approaching. 
Several years after this appalling sacrifice of 
human life, in 1855, he got into trouble with 
the British government. He was captured by 
the British forces and banished to some obscure 
and remote corner in India where he led a 
most ignominious life, hated by the whole 
Chinese nation, and despised by the world at 
large. 

On my return to headquarters, after my visit 
to the execution ground, I felt faint-hearted and 
depressed in spirit. I had no appetite for food, 
and when night came, I was too nervous for 
sleep. The scene I had looked upon during the 
day had stirred me up. I thought then that the 
Taiping rebels had ample grounds to justify 
their attempt to overthrow the Manchu regime. 
My sympathies were thoroughly enlisted in their 
favor and I thought seriously of making prepa- 
rations to join the Taiping rebels, but upon a 
calmer reflection, I fell back on the original plan 
of doing my best to recover the Chinese lan- 
guage as fast as I possibly could and of following 
the logical course of things, in order to accom- 
plish the object I had at heart.

在隆冬时节，通往东方的航线本应绕过合恩角，而非好望角。若是如此，我们从纽约到香港的航程无疑会一路顺风，不仅能大大缩短航程，还能省下船长无数的咒骂与不可估量的神经折磨。但我只是个乘客，对将船空载且未加压舱物，逆着东北季风航行的财务动机一无所知。若能绕行合恩角，我倒很乐意，那将为我环游世界之旅添上一条新航线，也将带来许多新的经历。

接近香港时，一位中国领港登船。船长要我问他附近是否有暗礁险滩。我怎么也想不起相应的中文词汇来翻译。幸好那位领港懂英文，而且还是第一个教我“暗礁”与“险滩”中文说法的中国老师。于是船长、梅西，还有其他几位在场的人便都笑话我——身为一个中国人，居然说不好中文。

一上岸，我首先想到的就是步行前往《中外新闻报》编辑部，去拜访该报主编兼老板安德鲁·肖特里德（Andrew Shortrede）——他曾在我求学蒙森学院期间资助我一年有余。见面后，他热情款待，并邀请我住进他家。我随即启程赶往澳门，去探望我年迈而亲爱的母亲——我知道她一直盼望见到她阔别多年的儿子。我们的重逢提前一天安排好了。那时我穿着西式便服，不便换成中装。我还蓄了胡子，而按照中国习俗，未婚男子不宜蓄须。我们见面时喜极而泣，满怀感恩与欣慰。起初我们激动得说不出话来，只能任由情感奔涌而出。情绪稍定后，她开始用双手抚摸我全身，倾诉这十年来被压抑的母爱。我们紧靠着坐下，我简要地向她讲述了我在美国的生活，因为我知道她对此极为关切。

我告诉她，我刚结束了一段为期五个月的漫长航程，旅途中并无危险；在美国的八年时光中，我所到之处都受到好心人的善待，身体健康，从未大病过。我此行的主要目的就是学习，为将来在中国的事业做准备。我向她解释，我必须先进入预科学校，才能进入大学；我后来进入的是耶鲁大学——美国最顶尖的大学之一，学制为四年，这就是我迟迟未归的原因。四年后，我以文学士学位（A.B.）毕业，这相当于中国的“秀才”头衔，意为“儒雅才俊”。这个学位刻在羊皮纸上。能够从耶鲁大学毕业，即便对美国本地人来说也是莫大荣耀，对一个中国人来说则尤为殊荣。她天真地问我，这个学位能带来多少钱。我告诉她，这学位并不立刻带来金钱，却能帮助人更快更容易地赚钱；它赋予人更大的影响力与社会地位。若能以学识为基石，并兼具良好品格，则更有机会成为领袖人物。我说，我的大学教育对我来说，比金钱更珍贵，我也有信心日后可以赚到很多钱。

我说：“知识就是力量，而力量比财富更重要。我是第一个从耶鲁大学毕业的中国人。您因此成为整个中国亿万母亲中，唯一一个可以自豪地说，自己养育了第一个从美国一流大学毕业的中国儿子的母亲。这是极为罕有的荣耀。”我还向她保证，只要我活着，定会无微不至地照顾她的起居，让她安享幸福。她听后神情欣慰，满脸幸福。谈话结束时，她意味深长地笑着看着我说：“我看你已经留起胡子了。你知道你还有一个年长许多的哥哥，他可还没蓄胡子呢。你必须把胡子刮掉。”我立刻听从了她的吩咐，面容干净地回到她面前，她满意地笑了，显然觉得我虽受了洋教育，但依旧保持着孝顺母亲的本分。若她能看见我的内心，便会知道我每一颗心跳都充满着对她最深挚的爱。她余生的岁月里，我有幸常伴左右，尽力让她舒适安逸。她于1858年去世，享年六十四岁，距父亲去世已二十四年。当时我人在上海，赶回故乡参加了她的葬礼。

1855年夏，我移居广州，与美部会宣教士Vrooman先生同住。他的传教据点位于“含哈兰”，靠近城西南的刑场，紧邻珠江岸边。在广州期间，我开始复习中文，努力重新掌握早年所学的粤语方言。在不到六个月内，我已基本恢复了粤语口语，尽管还有些生疏。与此同时，我也在缓慢恢复书面语的阅读与书写能力——我在1846年离开中国前，只学了四年中文，根基不算牢。在中国，书面语与口语之间的差异远远超过英语。中文书面语文绉绉，充满格式与套语，通行于全国，但各地发音各异。口语则分化为无数方言，在福建、安徽、江苏等地，不同地区的人之间在口语上几乎如外国人般难以沟通。这是中国象形文字与口语系统的特殊性。

我在广州居住的这半年，正值广东省局势混乱。广州百姓试图发起一场省内叛乱，与当时在中国内陆风起云涌的太平天国运动并无关联。为了扼杀这场叛乱于萌芽之中，时任两广总督的叶名琛采取了极端手段：据传在1855年夏，他共斩首七万五千人，其中大多数人被认为是无辜的。正如前面提到，我所住之处距刑场不到半英里。有一天出于好奇，我步行前往一探，所见惨不忍睹——地面血迹斑斑，两旁堆满无头尸体，等着被运走下葬。然而官府对尸体处理毫无准备，行刑规模远超预期，根本未安排足够的掩埋之地。这些尸体暴晒在炎炎夏日之下，当时日温常在华氏90度（约摄氏32度）以上，周围两千码范围内弥漫着毒气与尸臭，血水渗透土地，尸体腐烂发出令人窒息的恶臭。令人惊讶的是，如此疫源之地，竟未引发大规模瘟疫，实属侥幸。最终在城西郊区找到一处深谷，临时作为尸坑，将成堆尸体倾倒其间。据说连泥土都不用掩埋——只见无数红色蛆虫群聚蠕动，景象恶心可怖，将尸体啃噬殆尽。

据说在1855年6月、7月、8月三个月中，共有七万五千人被斩首，其中半数以上并未参与叛乱，而是被诬陷，以便勒索赎金。这场屠杀之惨烈，堪称近代文明史无前例，甚至超过卡利古拉、尼禄，乃至法国大革命时期的暴行。这一切皆由叶名琛——1854年起任两广总督——一手造成。

叶名琛是汉阳人，汉阳为汉口一部分，后来被太平军攻破、化为灰烬。据说叶在汉阳有大批产业，全数毁于战火，因此对太平军心怀仇恨。而太平军领袖多出身两广，他便将这份私仇迁怒全体广东人。身为总督，他遂借公权以私怨，疯狂报复，才有如此滥杀无辜、不加审讯，任人如牲畜般屠戮的惨剧。

然而，这个“人间魔鬼”万没想到，报应之日不远矣。数年之后，他因与英国发生外交冲突而被英军俘获，流放印度某个偏远角落，度过了身败名裂的一生，举国痛恨，举世唾弃。

那天我从刑场回来，心情极度低落，食不下咽，夜不能寐。眼前所见惨状令我震撼至极。我一度觉得太平军反清有理，深感同情，甚至认真考虑是否加入他们。但冷静下来后，我还是决定按原定计划，专心恢复中文能力，循序渐进，达成心中夙愿。

隆冬时节本应绕行合恩角东行，而非逆着东北季风穿越好望角——前者不仅能缩短航程，更可免去船长无数咒骂与神经损耗。但作为乘客，我无从知晓这艘空载船只背后的经济动机。当香港的领航员登船时，发生了戏剧性一幕：船长让我询问附近险礁，我却一时语塞忘了中文说法，反倒是领航员用英语解了围，引得众人哄笑——这个不会说母语的中国人。

上岸后，我立即拜访了曾资助我蒙森学院生活的《德臣报》主笔萧德锐先生。接受他的盛情款待后，便匆匆赶往澳门探望慈母。我们母子重逢的场景令人动容：身着西服、蓄着八字胡的我（这在中国未婚青年中实属不伦不类）与母亲相拥而泣。当她抚遍我全身时，十年思念尽在不言中。我详细讲述了耶鲁求学历程，当解释文学士学位相当于"秀才"时，她天真地问及俸禄几何。"知识就是力量，而力量胜过财富，"我握着她的手说，"您是中华千万母亲中，唯一拥有美国一流学府毕业儿子的母亲。"这番谈话后，她笑着提醒我剃去胡须——因长兄尚未蓄须——我立即遵从，见她满意地笑了，显然欣慰于洋学堂并未磨灭我的孝心。

1855年夏，我寄居在广州美国公理会传教士弗鲁曼先生家中，位于城西南珠江河畔的刑场附近。正当我重拾荒废多年的粤语和文言时，广州城爆发了不同于太平天国的本地起义。两广总督叶名琛采取铁血手段，在六月至八月间竟处决七万五千人。某日我出于好奇前往刑场，所见景象触目惊心：血泊中无头尸骸堆积如山，在90华氏度的酷暑中迅速腐败，空气中弥漫着令人作呕的尸臭。据说半数遇难者实属无辜，这场堪比罗马暴君的大屠杀，源于叶名琛对太平军焚毁其汉阳家产的私愤。当他后来被英军流放印度时，举国称快。

那次探视后，我数日食不下咽、夜不能寐。眼前的暴行让我彻底理解了太平军起义的合理性，几乎要投笔从戎。但冷静思量后，我决定仍按原计划精进中文修养，以更理性的方式践行救国理想。
