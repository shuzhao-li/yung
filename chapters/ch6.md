CHAPTER VI 
RETURN TO CHINA 

In entering upon my life's work which to me 
was so full of meaning and earnestness, the first 
episode was a voyage back to the old country, 
which I had not seen for nearly ten years, but 
which had never escaped my mind's eye nor my 
heart's yearning for her welfare. I wanted very 
much to stay a few years longer in order to take 
a scientific course. I had taken up surveying in 
the Sheffield Scientific School just as that de- 
partment was starting into existence under 
Professor Norton. Had I had the means to 
prosecute a practical profession, that might have 
helped to shorten and facilitate the way to the 
goal I had in view; but as I was poor and my 
friends thought that a longer stay in this country 
might keep me here for good, and China would 
lose me altogether, I was for this and other 
reasons induced to return. The scientific course 
was accordingly abandoned. The persons who 
were most interested in my return to China were 
Pelatiah Perit of Messrs. Goodhue & Co., mer- 



RETURN TO CHINA 43 

chants in the China trade, and the Olyphant 
Brothers, who had taken such a lively interest 
eight years before in helping me to come over in 
their ship, the "Huntress." These gentlemen 
had no other motive in desiring me to return to 
China than that of hoping to see me useful in 
Christianizing the Chinese, which was in harmony 
with their well-known broad and benevolent 
characters. 

On the 13th of November, 1854, the Rev. 
William Allen Macy, who went out to Hong 
Kong to take the place of the Rev, Dr. Brown, 
as teacher in the Morrison Education Society 
School in 1845, went back to China as a mis- 
sionary under the American Board, and we were 
fellow-passengers on board the sailing clipper 
ship "Eureka," under Captain Whipple, of 
Messrs. Chamber, Heisser & Co., of New York. 

Winter is the worst season of the year to go 
on an eastern voyage in a sailing vessel, via the 
Cape of Good Hope. The northeast trade winds 
prevail then and one is sure to have head winds all 
the way. The "Eureka," in which Macy and 
myself were the only passengers, took that route 
to Hong Kong. We embarked on board of her 
as she rode in midstream of the East River. The 
day was bleak and bitingly cold. No handker- 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

chiefs were fluttering in the air, waving a good 
voyage; no sound from the shore cheered us as 
the anchor was weighed, and as the tug towed us 
out as far as Sandy Hook. There we were left 
to our own resources. The sails were not furled 
to their full extent, but were reefed for tacking, 
as the wind was nearly dead ahead and quite 
strong. We found the "Eureka" to be empty 
of cargo, and empty even of ballast of any 
kind; for that reason she acted like a sailor who 
had just had his nip before he went out to sea. 
She tossed up and down and twisted from right 
to left, just as though she had a little too much 
to keep her balance. It was in such a fashion that 
she reeled her way from Sandy Hook to Hong 
Kong a distance of nearly 13,000 nautical 
miles, which took her 154 days to accom- 
plish. It was decidedly the most uninteresting 
and wearisome voyage I ever took in my life. 
The skipper was a Philadelphian. He had the 
unfortunate habit of stuttering badly, which 
tended to irritate a temper naturally quick and 
fiery. He was certainly a ludicrous object to 
look at. It was particularly in the morning that 
he might be seen pacing the quarter deck, scan- 
ning the sky. This, by the spectator, was 
deemed necessary for the skipper to work him- 



RETURN TO CHINA 45 

self up to the right pitch, preliminary to his pan- 
tomimic performances in his hattle with the head 
wind. All at once, he halted, stared at the quar- 
ter of the sky from whence the malicious head 
wind came. With a face all bloated and red- 
dened by intense excitement, his eyes almost 
standing out of their sockets, and all ablaze with 
uncontrollable rage, with arms uplifted, he 
would clutch his hair as if plucking it out by the 
roots, gnash his teeth, and simultaneously he 
would jump up and down, stamping on the deck, 
and swear at the Almighty for sending him head 
winds. The air for the moment was split with 
his revolting imprecations and blasphemous 
oaths that were ejaculated through the laborious 
process of stammering and stuttering, which 
made him a most pitiable object to behold. In 
the early part of the voyage it was a painful 
sight to see him working himself up to that pitch 
of contortion and paroxysm of rage which made 
him appear more like an insane than a sane man, 
but as these exhibitions were of daily occurrence 
for the greater part of the voyage, we came to 
regard him as no longer deserving of sympathy 
and pity, but rather with contempt. After his 
passion had spent its force, and he subsided into 
his calmer and normal mood, he would drop 



46 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

limply into a cane chair, where he would sit for 
hours all by himself. For the sake of diversion, 
he would rub his hands together, and soliloquize 
quietly to himself, an occasional smile breaking 
over his face, which made him look like an inno- 
cent idiot. Before the voyage was half through, 
the skipper had made such a fool of himself 
through his silly and insane conduct about the 
wind, that he became the laughing stock of the 
whole crew, who, of course, did not dare to show 
any outward signs of insubordination. The sail- 
ing of the vessel was entirely in the hands of the 
first mate, who was literally a sea-tyrant. The 
crew was composed of Swedes and Norwegians. 
If it had been made up of Americans, the in- 
human treatment by the officers might have 
driven them to desperate extremities, because the 
men were over- worked night and day in incessant 
tacking. The only time that they found a 
resting spell was when the ship was becalmed in 
the tropics when not a breath of wind was to be 
had for several days at a time. Referring to my 
diary kept in that memorable voyage, it took 
us nearly two weeks to beat up the Macassar 
straits. This event tried our patience sorely. 
After it was passed, the skipper made the 
remark within the hearing of the Rev, Macy 



RETURN TO CHINA 47 

that the reason he had bad luck was because he 
had a Jonah on board. My friend Macy took 
the remark in a good-natured way and gave me 
a significant smile. We were just then discuss- 
ing the feat of going through the Macassar 
straits and I remarked in a tone just loud 
enough to be heard by the old skipper that if I 
had charge of the vessel, I could take her through 
in less than ten days. This was meant as a direct 
reflection on the poor seamanship of the old 
fellow (for he really was a miserable sailor), as 
well as to serve as a retaliation for what he said 
a few minutes before, that there was a Jonah on 
board. 

In the dead of winter, the passage to the East 
should have been taken around Cape Horn 
instead of the Cape of Good Hope, in which 
case we would no doubt have had strong and fair 
wind all the way from New York to Hong 
Kong, which would not only have shortened the 
voyage but also saved the captain a world of 
swearing and an incalculable amount of wear 
and tear on his nervous system. But as a pas- 
senger only, I had no idea of the financial motive 
back of the move to send the ship off perfectly 
empty and unballasted, right in the teeth of the 
northeast monsoon. I would have been glad to 



48 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

go around Cape Horn, as that would have added 
a new route to my journeying around the world, 
and furnished me with new incidents as well. 

As we approached Hong Kong, a Chinese 
pilot boarded us. The captain wanted me to ask 
him whether there were any dangerous rocks and 
shoals nearby. I could not for the life of me 
recall my Chinese in order to interpret for him; 
the pilot himself understood English, and he was 
the first Chinese teacher to give me the terms in 
Chinese for dangerous rocks and shoals. So the 
skipper and Macy, and a few other persons who 
were present at the time, had the laugh on me, 
who, being a Chinese, yet was not able to speak 
the language. 

My first thought upon landing was to walk up 
to the office of the "China Mail," to pay my 
respects to Andrew Shortrede, the proprietor 
and editor of the paper, and the friend who sup- 
ported me for over a year, while I was in 
Monson Academy. After seeing him and 
accepting his hospitality by way of an invitation 
to take up my quarters in his house, I lost no 
time in hastening over to Macao to see my aged 
and beloved mother, who, I knew, yearned to 
see her long-absent boy. Our meeting was 
arranged a day beforehand. I was in citizen's 



RETURN TO CHINA 49 

dress and could not conveniently change the 
same for my Chinese costume. I had also 
allowed a pair of mustaches to grow, which, 
according to Chinese custom, was not becoming 
for an unmarried young man to do. We met 
with tears of joy, gratitude and thanksgiving. 
Our hearts were too full even to speak at first. 
We gave way to our emotions. As soon as we 
were fairly composed, she began to stroke me all 
over, as expressive of her maternal endearment 
which had been held in patient suspense for at 
least ten years. As we sat close to each other, I 
gave her a brief recital of my life in America, 
for I knew she would be deeply interested in the 
account. I told her that I had just finished a 
long and wearisome voyage of five months' dura- 
tion, but had met with no danger of any kind ; that 
during my eight years of sojourn in the United 
States, I was very kindly treated by the good 
people everywhere; that I had had good health 
and never been seriously sick, and that my chief 
object during the eight years was to study and 
prepare myself for my life work in China. I 
explained to her that I had to go through a 
preparatory school before entering college; that 
the college I entered was Yale one of the lead- 
ing colleges of the United States, and that the 



50 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

course was four years, which accounted for my 
long stay and delayed my return to China. I 
told her that at the end of four years I had grad- 
uated with the degree of A.B., analogous to the 
Chinese title of Siu Tsai, which is interpreted 
"Elegant Talent;" that it was inscribed on a 
parchment of sheep skin and that to graduate 
from Yale College was considered a great honor, 
even to a native American, and much more so to 
a Chinese. She asked me naively how much 
money it conferred. I said it did not confer any 
money at once, hut it enabled one to make money 
quicker and easier than one can who has not been 
educated ; that it gave one greater influence and 
power among men and if he built on his college 
education, he would be more likely to become the 
leader of men, especially if he had a well-estab- 
lished character. I told her my college education 
was worth more to me than money, and that I 
was confident of making plenty of money, 

"Knowledge," I said, "is power, and power is 
greater than riches. I am the first Chinese to 
graduate from Yale College, and that being the 
case, you have the honor of being the first and 
only mother out of the countless millions of 
mothers in China at this time, who can claim the 
honor of having a son who is the first Chinese 



RETURN TO CHINA 51 

graduate of a first-class American college. Such 
an honor is a rare thing to possess." I also 
assured her that as long as I lived all her com- 
forts and wants would be scrupulously and 
sedulously looked after, and that nothing would 
be neglected to make her contented and happy. 
This interview seemed to give her great comfort 
and satisfaction. She seemed very happy over 
it. After it was ended, she looked at me with a 
significant smile and said, "I see you have 
already raised your mustaches. You know you 
have a brother who is much older than you are ; 
he hasn't grown his mustaches yet. You must 
have yours off," I promptly obeyed her mandate, 
and as I entered the room with a clean face, she 
smiled with intense satisfaction, evidently think- 
ing that with all my foreign education, I had not 
lost my early training of being obedient to my 
mother. And if she could only have read my 
heart, she would have found how every throb 
palpitated with the most tender love for her. 
During the remaining years of her life, I had 
the rare privilege of seeing her often and 
ministered to her every comfort that it was in 
my power to bestow. She passed away in 1858, 
at the age of sixty-four, twenty-four years after 
the death of my father. I was in Shanghai at 



52 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the time of her death. I returned to my native 
village in time to attend her funeral. 

In the summer of 1855, I took up my resi- 
dence in Canton, with the Rev. Mr. Vrooman, 
a missionary under the American Board. His 
headquarters were in Ham Ha Lan, in the 
vicinity of the government execution ground, 
which is in the southwestern outskirts of the 
city, close to the bank of the Pearl River. While 
there, I began my Chinese studies and com- 
menced to regain the dialect of Canton, which 
I had forgotten during my stay in the United 
States. In less than six months, the language 
came back to me readily, although I was still a 
little rusty in it. I was also making slow progress 
in recovering the written language, in which I 
was not well-grounded before leaving China, in 
1846. I had studied it only four years, which 
was considered a short time in which to master 
the written language. There is a greater dif- 
ference between the written and the spoken 
language of China than there is between the 
written and spoken English language. The 
Chinese written language is stilted and full of 
conventional forms. It is understood through- 
out the whole empire, but differently pronounced 
in different provinces and localities. The 



RETURN TO CHINA 53 

spoken language is cut up Into endless dialects 
and in certain provinces like Fuhkien, Anliui 
and Kiangsu, the people are as foreigners to 
each other in the matter of dialects. Such are 
the peculiar characteristics of the ideographic 
and spoken languages of China. 

During the six months of my residence in 
Canton, while trying to recover both the written 
and spoken languages, Kwang Tung province 
was thrown into a somewhat disorganized 
condition. The people of Canton attempted to 
raise a provincial insurrection or rebellion 
entirely distinct from the Taiping rebellion 
which was being carried on in the interior of 
China with marked success. To suppress and 
nip it in the bud, drastic measures were resorted 
to by Viceroy Yeh Ming Hsin, who, in the 
summer of 1855, decapitated seventy-five thou- 
sand people, most of whom, I was told, were 
innocent. My residence was within half a mile 
of the execution ground, as stated above, and one 
day, out of curiosity, I ventured to walk over 
to the place. But, oh ! what a sight. The ground 
was perfectly drenched with human blood. On 
both sides of the driveway were to be seen head- 
less human trunks, piled up in heaps, waiting to 
be taken away for burial. But no provision 



54 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

had been made to facilitate their removal. 
The execution was carried on on a larger scale 
than had been expected, and no provision had 
been made to find a place large enough to bury 
all the bodies. There they were, left exposed 
to a burning sun. The temperature stood from 
morning to night in midsummer steadily at 90 
Fahrenheit, and sometimes higher. The atmos- 
phere within a radius of two thousand yards of 
the execution ground was heavily charged with 
the poisonous and pestilential vapor that was 
reeking from the ground already over-saturated 
with blood and from the heaps of corpses which 
had been left behind for at least two days, and 
which showed signs of rapid decomposition. It 
was a wonder to me that no virulent epidemic 
had sprung up from such an infectious spot to 
decimate the compact population of the city of 
Canton. It was a fortunate circumstance that 
at last a deep and extensive ravine, located in 
the far-off outskirts of the western part of the 
city, was found, which was at once con- 
verted into a sepulchral receptacle into which 
this vast human hecatomb was dumped. It was 
said that no earth was needed to be thrown over 
these corpses to cover them up; the work was 
accomplished by countless swarms of worms of a 



RETURN TO CHINA 55 

reddish hue and of an appearance that was per- 
fectly hideous and revolting. 

I was told that during the months of June, 
July and August, of 1855, seventy-five thousand 
people had been decapitated; that more than half 
of that number were declared to be innocent of the 
charge of rebellion, but that the accusation was 
made as a pretext to exact money from them* 
This wholesale slaughter, unparalleled in the 
annals of modern civilization, eclipsing even the 
enormities and blood-thirstiness of Caligula and 
Nero, or even the French Revolution, was per- 
petrated by Yeh Ming Hsin, who was appointed 
viceroy of Kwang Tung and Kwangsi in 
1854. 

Yeh Ming Hsin was a native of Han- Yang. 
Han- Yang is a part of the port of Hankau, and 
was destroyed with it when the Taiping rebels 
took possession of it. It was said that Yeh 
Ming Hsin had immense estates in Han- Yang, 
which were completely destroyed by fire. This 
circumstance embittered him towards the Tai- 
ping rebels and as the Taiping leaders hailed 
from Kwang Tung and Kwangsi, he naturally 
transferred his hatred to the people of those two 
provinces. It was in the lofty position of a 
viceroy that he found his opportunity to wreak 



56 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

his private and personal vengeance upon the 
Canton people. This accounts for his indiscrim- 
inate slaughter of them, and for the fact that he 
did not deign to give them even the semblance 
of a trial, but hurried them from life to death 
like packs of cattle to the shambles. 

But this human monster did not dream that 
his day of reckoning was fast approaching. 
Several years after this appalling sacrifice of 
human life, in 1855, he got into trouble with 
the British government. He was captured by 
the British forces and banished to some obscure 
and remote corner in India where he led a 
most ignominious life, hated by the whole 
Chinese nation, and despised by the world at 
large. 

On my return to headquarters, after my visit 
to the execution ground, I felt faint-hearted and 
depressed in spirit. I had no appetite for food, 
and when night came, I was too nervous for 
sleep. The scene I had looked upon during the 
day had stirred me up. I thought then that the 
Taiping rebels had ample grounds to justify 
their attempt to overthrow the Manchu regime. 
My sympathies were thoroughly enlisted in their 
favor and I thought seriously of making prepa- 
rations to join the Taiping rebels, but upon a 



RETURN TO CHINA 57 

calmer reflection, I fell back on the original plan 
of doing my best to recover the Chinese lan- 
guage as fast as I possibly could and of following 
the logical course of things, in order to accom- 
plish the object I had at heart.
