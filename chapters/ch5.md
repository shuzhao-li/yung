CHAPTER V 
MY COLLEGE DAYS 

Before entering Yale, I had not solved the 
problem of how I was to be carried through the 
collegiate course without financial backing of a 
definite and well-assured character. It was an 
easy matter to talk about getting an education 
by working for it, and there is a kind of romance 
in it that captivates the imagination, but it is 
altogether a different thing to face it in a busi- 
ness and practical way. So it proved to me, 
after I had put my foot into it. I had no one 
except Brown, who had already done so much 
for me in bringing me to this country, and 
Hammond, who fitted me for college. To them 
I appealed for advice and counsel. I was ad- 
vised to avail myself of the contingent fund 
provided for indigent students. It was in the 
hands of the trustees of the academy and so 
well guarded that it could not be appropriated 
without the recipient's signing a written pledge 
that he would study for the ministry and after- 
wards become a missionary. Such being the 
case, I made up my mind that it would be 
utterly useless for me to apply for the fund. 
However, a day was appointed for me to meet 
the trustees in the parsonage, to talk over the 
subject. They said they would be too glad to 
have me avail myself of the fund, provided I was 
willing to sign a pledge that after graduation I 
should go back to China as a missionary. I gave 
the trustees to understand that I would never 
give such a pledge for the following reasons: 
First, it would handicap and circumscribe my 
usefulness. I wanted the utmost freedom of 
action to avail myself of every opportunity to 
do the greatest good in China. If necessary, I 
might be obliged to create new conditions, if I 
found old ones were not favorable to any plan I 
might have for promoting her highest welfare. 

In the second place, the calling of a missionary 
is not the only sphere in life where one can do the 
most good in China or elsewhere. In such a vast 
empire, there can be hardly any limit put upon 
one's ambition to do good, if one is possessed of 
the Christ-spirit; on the other hand, if one has 
not such a spirit, no pledge in the world could 
melt his ice-bound soul. 

In the third place, a pledge of that character 
would prevent me from taking advantage of any 
circumstance or event that might arise in the 
life of a nation like China, to do her a great 
service. 

"For these reasons," I said, "I must decline 
to give the pledge and at the same time decline 
to accept your kind offer to help me. I thank 
you, gentlemen, very much, for your good 
wishes."

Both Brown and Hammond afterwards 
agreed that I took the right view on the subject 
and sustained me in my position. To be sure, 
I was poor, but I would not allow my poverty 
to gain the upper hand and compel me to barter 
away my inward convictions of duty for a 
temporary mess of pottage. 

During the summer of 1850, it seems that 
Brown who had been making a visit in the South 
to see his sister, while there had occasion to call 
on some of the members of "The Ladies' Associa- 
tion" in Savannah, Ga., to whom he mentioned 
my case. He returned home in the nick of time, 
just after I had the interview with the 
board of trustees of the academy. I told him 
of the outcome, when, as stated above, he 
approved of my position, and told me what he 
had done. He said that the members of the 
association agreed to help me in college. On 
the strength of that I gathered fresh courage, 
and went down to New Haven to pass my ex- 
amination for entrance. How I got in, I do not 
know, as I had had only fifteen months of Latin 
and twelve months of Greek, and ten months of 
mathematics. My preparation had been inter- 
rupted because the academy had been broken up 
by the Palmer & New London R,R. that was 
being built close by. As compared with 
the college preparations of nine-tenths of my 
class-mates, I was far behind. However, I 
passed without condition. But I was convinced 
I was not sufficiently prepared, as my recitations 
in the class-room clearly proved. Between the 
struggle of how to make ends meet financially 
and how to keep up with the class in my studies, 
I had a pretty tough time of it. I used to sweat 
over my studies till twelve o'clock every night 
the whole Freshman year. I took little or no 
exercise and my health and strength began to 
fail and I was obliged to ask for a leave of 
absence of a week. I went to East Windsor to 
get rested and came back refreshed. 

In the Sophomore year, from my utter aversion 
to mathematics, especially to differential 
and integral calculus, which I abhorred and 
detested, and which did me little or no good in 
the way of mental discipline, I used to fizzle 
and flunk so often that I really thought I was 
going to be dropped from the class, or dismissed 
from college. But for some unexplained reasons 
I was saved from such a catastrophe, and I 
squeezed through the second year in college with 
so low a mark that I was afraid to ask my 
division tutor, who happened to be Tutor Blodget, 
who had me in Greek, about it. The only re- 
deeming feature that saved me as a student in 
the class of 1854, was the fortunate circumstance 
that I happened to be a successful competitor 
on two occasions in English composition in my 
division. I was awarded the first prize in the 
second term, and the first prize in the third term 
of the year. These prizes gave rne quite an eclat 
in the college as well as in the outside world, 
but I was not at all elated over them on account 
of my poor scholarship which I felt keenly 
through the whole college course. 

Before the close of my second year, I succeeded 
in securing the stewardship of a boarding 
club consisting of sophomores and juniors. 
There were altogether twenty members. I did 
all the marketing and served at the table. In 
this way, I earned my board through the latter 
half of my college course. In money matters, I 
was supplied with remittances from "The 
Ladies' Association" in Savannah, and also con- 
tributions from the Olyphant Brothers of New 
York. In addition to these sources of supply, I 
was paid for being an assistant librarian to the 
"Brothers in Unity," which was one of the two 
college debating societies that owned a library, 
and of which I was a member. 

In my senior year I was again elected librarian 
to the same Society and got $30.00. These 
combined sums were large enough to meet all my 
cash bills, since my wants had to be finely 
trimmed to suit the cloth. If most of the country 
parsons of that period could get along with a 
salary of $200 or $300 a year (supplemented, of 
course, with an annual donation party, which 
sometimes carried away more than it donated) , 
having as a general thing a large family to look 
after, I certainly ought to have been able to get 
through college with gifts of nearly a like 
amount, supplemented with donations of shirts 
and stockings from ladies who took an interest in 
my education. 

The class of 1854, to which I had the honor 
and the good fortune to belong, graduated nine- 
ty-eight all told. Being the first Chinaman who 
had ever been known to go through a first-class 
American college, I naturally attracted consid- 
erable attention; and from the fact that I was 
librarian for one of the college debating 
societies (Linonia was the other) for two years, 
I was known by members of the three classes 
above, and members of the three classes below 
me. This fact had contributed toward familiar- 
izing me with the college world at large, and my 
nationality, of course, added piquancy to my 
popularity. 

As an undergraduate, I had already acquired 
a factitious reputation within the walls of Yale. 
But that was ephemeral and soon passed out of 
existence after graduation. 

All through my college course, especially in 
the closing year, the lamentable condition of 
China was before my mind constantly and 
weighed on my spirits. In my despondency, I 
often wished I had never been educated, as 
education had unmistakably enlarged my mental 
and moral horizon, and revealed to me responsi- 
bilities which the sealed eye of ignorance can 
never see, and sufferings and wrongs of human- 
ity to which an uncultivated and callous nature 
can never be made sensitive. The more one. 
knows, the more he suffers and is consequently 
less happy; the less one knows, the less he suffers, 
and hence is more happy. But this is a low view 
of life, a cowardly feeling and unworthy of a 
being hearing the impress of divinity. I had 
started out to get an education. By dint of hard 
work and self-denial I had finally secured the 
coveted prize and although it might not be so 
complete and symmetrical a thing as could he 
desired, yet I had come right up to the conven- 
tional standard and idea of a liberal education. 
I could, therefore, call myself an educated man 
and, as such, it behooved me to ask, "What am 
I going to do with my education?" Before the 
close of my last year in college I had already 
sketched out what I should do. I was determined 
that the rising generation of China should enjoy 
the same educational advantages that I had en- 
joyed; that through western education China 
might be regenerated, become enlightened and 
powerful. To accomplish that object became the 
guiding star of my ambition. Towards such a 
goal, I directed all my mental resources and 
energy. Through thick and thin, and the vicissitudes 
of a checkered life from 1854 to 1872, I 
labored and waited for its consummation.

第五章
我的大学时光

在进入耶鲁大学之前，我尚未解决一个根本问题：没有明确而可靠的经济支持，我该如何完成整个大学课程？人们常说可以靠自己劳动来换取教育，这听起来轻松，也带有一种浪漫色彩，容易激发人的想象力，但真正从现实和实务角度面对它时，情况就大不相同了。我亲身经历后，深有体会。除了布朗先生——他已为我来到美国做出了极大努力——以及帮助我准备大学课程的哈蒙德先生之外，我无人可依。因此我向他们寻求建议和指导。

他们建议我申请专为贫困学生设立的周转基金。该基金由学院理事会掌管，设有严格条件，申请人必须签署书面承诺，将来修读神学并回国担任传教士。鉴于此条件，我当即断定自己不适合申请此项资助。

尽管如此，我仍被安排在牧师的寓所与理事会成员会面，进一步商谈此事。他们表示，非常乐意我使用这笔基金，只要我愿意签署承诺书，表示毕业后回中国担任传教士。我向他们明确表示，基于以下几点原因，我无法做出这样的承诺：

第一，这会限制我的行动自由与发挥潜能。我希望在中国行事能拥有最大自由，以便抓住一切有利时机为国家谋最大利益。若现有体制不利于我推进改革目标，我可能需要创造新的局面。

第二，成为传教士并不是唯一能在中国或世界其他地方发挥巨大影响的方式。在中国这样一个广袤的国家，如果一个人拥有基督精神，其行善之志几乎无可限制；反之，若没有那样的精神，即便签署再多承诺书，也无法唤醒其冷漠之心。

第三，这种性质的承诺将限制我在中国国运演变过程中所能把握的历史机遇，从而无法在关键时刻为国家做出重要贡献。

“正因如此，”我对他们说，“我必须婉拒签署承诺，也同时谢绝你们的慷慨资助。我非常感谢诸位的好意。”

布朗和哈蒙德后来都认同我对这件事的看法，并坚定支持我的立场。的确，我很贫穷，但我不会让贫穷压倒我、迫使我出卖内心对职责的信念，换取一时的安逸。

1850年夏天，布朗先生前往美国南部探望姐姐，在乔治亚州萨凡纳城拜访了“妇女协会”的一些成员，并向她们提到了我的情况。他恰好在我与学院理事会会面后及时返回，我将事情原委告诉他，他表示赞同我的选择，并告诉我他在萨凡纳所做的努力。他说那里的妇女协会成员决定资助我完成大学学业。得此消息，我备受鼓舞，随即前往纽黑文参加耶鲁入学考试。

我至今也不知自己是如何被录取的——我只学了十五个月的拉丁文、十二个月的希腊文以及十个月的数学。由于修建帕尔默至新伦敦铁路正好穿过学院附近，教学一度中断，我的准备远远落后于绝大多数同班同学。然而，我竟无条件通过了入学考试。

但我深知自己准备不足，这一点从课堂上的答问就可见一斑。在一边要解决生活费用问题，一边还得追赶学业进度的双重压力下，我度过了极其艰辛的大一生活。整个新生年，我几乎每天熬夜到午夜苦读，很少运动，导致健康严重下滑，不得不申请一周假期前往东温莎休养，回来后才恢复精力。

升入大二后，我对数学，尤其是微积分产生极大反感——我痛恨它，鄙视它，而且它对我思维锻炼毫无益处。因此我常在这门课上失败，几乎以为自己会被降级甚至开除。但不知何故，我还是勉强熬过了第二年，成绩低得令我羞于向分班导师（也是教我希腊文的布洛杰特导师）询问成绩。

让我在1854届耶鲁本科生中保住“学生”这个身份的唯一亮点，是我两次在英文作文比赛中获奖。我在第二学期和第三学期分别获得第一名。这两个奖项不仅让我在耶鲁校内名声大振，在校外也受到关注，但我却因整体学术表现不佳而始终难以自豪。

在大二结束前，我成功获得一个食堂管理员的职位，负责二十位大二和大三学生的伙食安排。我负责采购并参与餐桌服务，从而赚得了后两年在校期间的食宿费用。

在资金方面，我持续得到来自萨凡纳“妇女协会”的汇款资助，同时也收到纽约奥利芬兄弟公司的捐款。此外，我还担任了“兄弟联合会”（耶鲁两个辩论社团之一）的图书馆助理，并从中获得报酬。

大四那年，我再次当选该社团图书馆管理员，获得三十美元酬金。这些收入加在一起，刚好足以支付我所有的现金支出。毕竟，我的生活需求已经被“削减到布料可裁的极限”。当时许多乡村牧师的年薪不过200至300美元，家中还要抚养多个孩子，偶尔靠教会举办的捐助聚会勉强支撑。相比之下，我有幸得到与此相当的捐助，还有善心女士送来的衬衫和袜子，我理应能够顺利完成学业。

我有幸加入了1854届，共计98人毕业。作为第一位完成一流美国大学课程的中国人，我自然引起了相当关注。再加上我连续两年担任辩论社图书馆管理员，这让我与上三届和下三届的许多学生都相识。这种跨年级的熟识度，使我在校园内颇具知名度，而我的国籍，更增添了些许别致与新鲜感。

本科期间，我在耶鲁校内已经小有名气，但这声誉不过是短暂的泡影，毕业之后很快就烟消云散了。

大学四年，尤其在最后一年，中国积弱不振的局势始终萦绕于我心头，令我深感压抑。在沮丧中，我常会想：也许我本不该受教育。因为教育拓宽了我的心智与道德视野，使我看到了那些无知眼睛永远无法洞察的责任与痛苦，也感受到了那些麻木之人无法体会的人类苦难与不公。一个人知道得越多，感受越多，往往越不幸福；知道得越少，反倒越能知足常乐。然而，这种想法未免过于消极软弱，也不配一个肩负神圣使命的人。

我既已踏上求学之路，靠着刻苦与克己终得所愿，虽不完美，也达到了社会对“通才教育”的标准。我可以自称为“受过教育的人”，而作为这样一个人，我必须问自己：“我将如何运用这份教育？”
在大学最后一年临近结束前，我已拟定方向。我立志让中国新一代享有我所接受的教育，让中国通过西方教育实现更新、觉醒与强盛。这个目标成了我毕生志向的北极星。

为此，我倾尽智慧与力量，从1854年至1872年间历经世事沉浮、苦乐悲欢，始终为这个梦想努力耕耘、静待实现。

第五章 耶鲁岁月

踏入耶鲁校门之前，我尚未解决那道现实难题：如何在没有稳定经济来源的情况下完成学业？人们总爱歌颂勤工俭学的浪漫，但真正直面其中艰辛时，却是另一番滋味。当我向布朗与哈蒙德求助时，他们建议我申请学院为清贫学生设立的专项基金——前提是签署誓约，承诺毕业后成为传教士。

在牧师公馆的会议室里，我向校董们坦陈拒绝的三重理由：首先，这将束缚我在中国随机应变的能力；其次，怀抱基督精神者，不必拘泥于传教士一职也能造福众生；最后，此类誓约会阻碍我把握服务祖国的特殊机遇。"因此，"我起身致意，"我必须谢绝诸位的美意。"这个决定获得了两位恩师的支持。贫穷固然难捱，但我不愿为了一碗红豆汤出卖灵魂的自由。

1850年夏，转机悄然而至。布朗先生拜访佐治亚州萨凡纳市的妇女协会时提及我的处境。正是靠着这些南方淑女们的资助，我得以参加耶鲁入学考试——尽管我的拉丁文仅修习十五个月，希腊文十二个月，数学十个月，远逊于九成同窗，却奇迹般免试预科直接录取。整个大一学年，我每晚苦读到子夜，健康严重受损，不得不请假回东温莎调养一周。

大二时，微积分成了我的噩梦。那些晦涩的符号令我屡屡挂科，若非在英文写作比赛中两度夺魁（这为我赢得全校瞩目），恐怕早已被勒令退学。为了生计，我承包了二十人餐饮俱乐部的采买与服务工作，同时兼任"同窗会"图书馆助理。萨凡纳妇女协会与纽约奥立芬兄弟的汇款，加上三十美元年薪的图书管理员职务，让我这个总是将衬衫袜子穿到补丁摞补丁的东方学生，得以像那些年薪二三百美元的乡村牧师般精打细算地生活。

1854年毕业典礼上，作为耶鲁建校以来首位中国毕业生，我站在九十八名同窗中格外醒目。在校期间担任两年辩论社团图书管理员的经历，使我成为六个年级学生熟知的"校园名人"。但这种虚名随着毕业很快烟消云散。

贯穿整个大学生涯——尤其是毕业前夕——中国积贫积弱的现状始终如阴云笼罩心头。教育拓展了我的精神疆界，却也让我看清了愚昧之眼永远无法察觉的民族苦难。知识愈多，痛苦愈深，这确是懦夫逃避思考的借口，却非神性印记承载者的担当。当终于获得梦寐以求的文凭时，那个盘旋已久的问题变得无比清晰："将用所受教育作何作为？"我在毕业前已勾勒出答案：要让更多中国青年获得西方教育，通过文明启蒙重塑祖国命运。这个信念成为1854至1872年间，我穿越人生浮沉始终不渝的北辰。
