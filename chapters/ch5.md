CHAPTER V 
MY COLLEGE DAYS 

Before entering Yale, I had not solved the 
problem of how I was to be carried through the 
collegiate course without financial backing of a 
definite and well-assured character. It was an 
easy matter to talk about getting an education 
by working for it, and there is a kind of romance 
in it that captivates the imagination, but it is 
altogether a different thing to face it in a busi- 
ness and practical way. So it proved to me, 
after I had put my foot into it. I had no one 
except Brown, who had already done so much 
for me in bringing me to this country, and 
Hammond, who fitted me for college. To them 
I appealed for advice and counsel. I was ad- 
vised to avail myself of the contingent fund 
provided for indigent students. It was in the 
hands of the trustees of the academy and so 
well guarded that it could not be appropriated 
without the recipient's signing a written pledge 
that he would study for the ministry and after- 
wards become a missionary. Such being the 



MY COLLEGE DAYS 85 

case, I made up my mind that it would be 
utterly useless for me to apply for the fund. 
However, a day was appointed for me to meet 
the trustees in the parsonage, to talk over the 
subject. They said they would be too glad to 
have me avail myself of the fund, provided I was 
willing to sign a pledge that after graduation I 
should go back to China as a missionary. I gave 
the trustees to understand that I would never 
give such a pledge for the following reasons: 
First, it would handicap and circumscribe my 
usefulness. I wanted the utmost freedom of 
action to avail myself of every opportunity to 
do the greatest good in China. If necessary, I 
might be obliged to create new conditions, if I 
found old ones were not favorable to any plan I 
might have for promoting her highest welfare. 

In the second place, the calling of a missionary 
is not the only sphere in life where one can do the 
most good in China or elsewhere. In such a vast 
empire, there can be hardly any limit put upon 
one's ambition to do good, if one is possessed of 
the Christ-spirit; on the other hand, if one has 
not such a spirit, no pledge in the world could 
melt his ice-bound soul. 

In the third place, a pledge of that character 
would prevent me from taking advantage of any

circumstance or event that might arise in the 
life of a nation like China, to do her a great 
service. 

'Tor these reasons/' I said, "I must decline 
to give the pledge and at the same time decline 
to accept your kind offer to help me. I thank 
you, gentlemen, very much, for your good 
wishes/' 

Both Brown and Hammond afterwards 
agreed that I took the right view on the subject 
and sustained me in my position. To be sure, 
I was poor, but I would not allow my poverty 
to gain the upper hand and compel me to barter 
away my inward convictions of duty for a 
temporary mess of pottage. 

During the summer of 1850, it seems that 
Brown who had been making a visit in the South 
to see his sister, while there had occasion to call 
on some of the members of "The Ladies' Associa- 
tion" in Savannah, Ga., to whom he mentioned 
my case. He returned home in the nick of time, 
just after I had the interview with the 
board of trustees of the academy. I told him 
of the outcome, when, as stated above, he 
approved of my position, and told me what he 
had done. He said that the members of the 
association agreed to help me in college. On 



MY COLLEGE DAYS 37 

the strength of that I gathered fresh courage, 
and went down to New Haven to pass my ex- 
amination for entrance. How I got in, I do not 
know, as I had had only fifteen months of Latin 
and twelve months of Greek, and ten months of 
mathematics. My preparation had been inter- 
rupted because the academy had been broken up 
by the Palmer & New London R,R. that was 
being built close by. As compared with 
the college preparations of nine-tenths of my 
class-mates, I was far behind. However, I 
passed without condition. But I was convinced 
I was not sufficiently prepared, as my recitations 
in the class-room clearly proved. Between the 
struggle of how to make ends meet financially 
and how to keep up with the class in my studies, 
I had a pretty tough time of it. I used to sweat 
over my studies till twelve o'clock every night 
the whole Freshman year. I took little or no 
exercise and my health and strength began to 
fail and I was obliged to ask for a leave of 
absence of a week. I went to East Windsor to 
get rested and came back refreshed. 

In the Sophomore year, from my utter aver- 
sion to mathematics, especially to differential 
and integral calculus, which I abhorred and 
detested, and which did me little or no good in 



38 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the way of mental discipline, I used to fizzle 
and flunk so often that I really thought I was 
going to be dropped from the class, or dismissed 
from college. But for some unexplained reasons 
I was saved from such a catastrophe, and I 
squeezed through the second year in college with 
so low a mark that I was afraid to ask my divi- 
sion tutor, who happened to be Tutor Blodget, 
who had me in Greek, about it. The only re- 
deeming feature that saved me as a student in 
the class of 1854, was the fortunate circumstance 
that I happened to be a successful competitor 
on two occasions in English composition in my 
division. I was awarded the first prize in the 
second term, and the first prize in the third term 
of the year. These prizes gave rne quite an eclat 
in the college as well as in the outside world, 
but I was not at all elated over them on account 
of my poor scholarship which I felt keenly 
through the whole college course. 

Before the close of my second year, I succeed- 
ed in securing the stewardship of a boarding 
club consisting of sophomores and juniors. 
There were altogether twenty members. I did 
all the marketing and served at the table. In 
this way, I earned my board through the latter 
half of my college course. In money matters, I 



MY COLLEGE DAYS 39 

was supplied with remittances from "The 
Ladies' Association" in Savannah, and also con- 
tributions from the Olyphant Brothers of New 
York. In addition to these sources of supply, I 
was paid for being an assistant librarian to the 
"Brothers in Unity," which was one of the two 
college debating societies that owned a library, 
and of which I was a member. 

In my senior year I was again elected librarian 
to the same Society and got $30.00. These 
combined sums were large enough to meet all my 
cash bills, since my wants had to be finely 
trimmed to suit the cloth. If most of the country 
parsons of that period could get along with a 
salary of $200 or $300 a year (supplemented, of 
course, with an annual donation party, which 
sometimes carried away more than it donated) , 
having as a general thing a large family to look 
after, I certainly ought to have been able to get 
through college with gifts of nearly a like 
amount, supplemented with donations of shirts 
and stockings from ladies who took an interest in 
my education. 

The class of 1854, to which I had the honor 
and the good fortune to belong, graduated nine- 
ty-eight all told. Being the first Chinaman who 
had ever been known to go through a first-class 



40 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

American college, I naturally attracted consid- 
erable attention; and from the fact that I was 
librarian for one of the college debating 
societies (Linonia was the other) for two years, 
I was known by members of the three classes 
above, and members of the three classes below 
me. This fact had contributed toward familiar- 
izing me with the college world at large, and my 
nationality, of course, added piquancy to my 
popularity. 

As an undergraduate, I had already acquired 
a factitious reputation within the walls of Yale. 
But that was ephemeral and soon passed out of 
existence after graduation. 

All through my college course, especially in 
the closing year, the lamentable condition of 
China was before my mind constantly and 
weighed on my spirits. In my despondency, I 
often wished I had never been educated, as 
education had unmistakably enlarged my mental 
and moral horizon, and revealed to me responsi- 
bilities which the sealed eye of ignorance can 
never see, and sufferings and wrongs of human- 
ity to which an uncultivated and callous nature 
can never be made sensitive. The more one. 
knows, the more he suffers and is consequently 
less happy; the less one knows, the less he suffers, 



MY COLLEGE DAYS 41 

and hence is more happy. But this is a low view 
of life, a cowardly feeling and unworthy of a 
being hearing the impress of divinity. I had 
started out to get an education. By dint of hard 
work and self-denial I had finally secured the 
coveted prize and although it might not be so 
complete and symmetrical a thing as could he 
desired, yet I had come right up to the conven- 
tional standard and idea of a liberal education. 
I could, therefore, call myself an educated man 
and, as such, it behooved me to ask, "What am 
I going to do with my education?" Before the 
close of my last year in college I had already 
sketched out what I should do. I was determined 
that the rising generation of China should enjoy 
the same educational advantages that I had en- 
joyed; that through western education China 
might be regenerated, become enlightened and 
powerful. To accomplish that object became the 
guiding star of my ambition. Towards such a 
goal, I directed all my mental resources and 
energy. Through thick and thin, and the vicissi- 
tudes of a checkered life from 1854 to 1872, I 
labored and waited for its consummation.
