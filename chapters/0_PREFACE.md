PKEFACE 

The first five chapters of this book give an 
account of my early education, previous to going 
to America, where it was continued, first at 
Monson Academy, in Monson, Massachusetts, 
and later, at Yale College. 

The sixth chapter begins with my reentrance 
into the Chinese world, after an absence of eight 
years. Would it not be strange, if an Occidental 
education, continually exemplified by an Occi- 
dental civilization, had not wrought upon an 
Oriental such a metamorphosis in his inward 
nature as to make him feel and act as though he 
were a being coming from a different world, 
when he confronted one so diametrically dif- 
ferent? This was precisely my case, and yet 
neither my patriotism nor the love of my fellow- 
countrymen had been weakened. On the con- 
trary, they had increased in strength from 
sympathy. Hence, the succeeding chapters of 
my book will be found to be devoted to the work- 
ing out of my educational scheme, as an expres- 
sion of my undying love for China, and as the

most feasible method to my mind, of reformation 
and regeneration for her. 

With the sudden ending of the Educational 
Commission, and the recall of the one hundred 
and twenty students who formed the vanguard 
of the pioneers of modern education in China, 
my educational work was brought to a close. 

Of the survivors of these students of 1872, a 
few by dint of hard, persistent industry, have at 
last come forth to stand in the front ranks of 
the leading statesmen of China, and it is through 
them that the original Chinese Educational 
Commission has been revived, though in a mod- 
ified form, so that now, Chinese students are seen 
flocking to America and Europe from even the 
distant shores of Sinim for a scientific education.
