CHAPTER XXII 
THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 

The coup d'etat of September, 1898, was an 
event memorable in the annals of the Manchu 
Dynasty. In it, the late Emperor Kwang Su 
was arbitrarily deposed; treasonably made a 
prisoner of state; and had his prerogatives and 
rights as Emperor of the Chinese Empire 
wrested from him and usurped by the late 
Dowager Empress Chi Hsi.

Kwang Su, though crowned Emperor when 
he was five years of age, had all along held the 
sceptre only nominally. It was Chi Hsi who 
held the helm of the government all the time. 

As soon as Kwang Su had attained his ma- 
jority, and began to exercise his authority as 
emperor, the lynx eye of Chi Hsi was never 
lifted away from him. His acts and movements 
were watched with the closest scrutiny, and were 
looked upon in any light but the right one, 
because her own stand in the government had 
never been the legitimate and straight one since 

1864, when her first regency over her own son, 
Tung Chi, woke in her an ambition to dominate 
and rule, which grew to he a passion too morhid 
and strong to be curbed. 

In the assertion of his true manhood, and the 
exercise of his sovereign power, his determina- 
tion to reform the government made him at once 
the cynosure of Peking, inside and outside of 
the Palace, In the eyes of the Dowager Em- 
press Chi Hsi, whose retina was darkened by 
deeds perpetrated in the interest of usurpation 
and blinded by jealousy, Kwang Su appeared in 
no other light than as a dement, or to use a milder 
expression, an imbecile, fit only to be tagged 
round by an apron string, cared for and watched. 
But to the disinterested spectator and unpreju- 
diced judge, Kwan Su was no imbecile, much 
less a dement. Impartial history and posterity 
will pronounce him not only a patriot emperor, 
but also a patriot reformer as mentally sound and 
sane as any emperor who ever sat on the throne 
of China. He may be looked upon as a most 
remarkable historical character of the Manchu 
Dynasty from the fact that he was singled out 
by an all-wise Providence to be the pioneer of 
the great reform movement in China at the 
threshold of the twentieth century. 

Just at this juncture of the political condition 
of China, the tide of reform had reached Peking. 
Emperor Kwang Su, under some mysterious in- 
fluence, to the astonishment of the world, stood 
forth as the exponent of this reform movement. 
I determined to remain in the city to watch its 
progress. My headquarters became the rendez- 
vous of the leading reformers of 1898. It was in 
the fall of that memorable year that the coup 
d'etat took place, in which the young Emperor 
Kwang Su was deposed by the Dowager 
Empress, and some of the leading reformers 
arrested and summarily decapitated. 

Being implicated by harboring the reformers, 
and in deep sympathy with them, I had to flee 
for my own life and succeeded in escaping from 
Peking. I took up quarters in the foreign set- 
tlement of Shanghai. While there, I organized 
the "Deliberative Association of China," of 
which I was chosen the first president. The 
object of the association was to discuss the 
leading question of the day, especially those of reform. 

In 1899, I was advised for my own personal 
safety, to change my residence. I went to Hong 
Kong and placed myself under the protection of 
the British government. 

I was in Hong Kong from 1900 till 1902, 
when I returned to the United States to see my 
younger son, Bartlett G. Yung, graduate from 
Yale University.

In the spring of 1901, I visited the Island of 
Formosa, and in that visit I called upon Vis- 
count Gentaro Kodama, governor of the island, 
who, in the Russo-Japan War of 1904-5 was 
the chief of staff to Marshal Oyama in Man- 
churia. In the interview our conversation had 
to be carried on through his interpreter, as he, 
Kodama, could not speak English nor could I 
speak Japanese. 

He said he was glad to see me, as he had heard 
a great deal of me, but never had the pleasure of 
meeting me. Now that he had the opportuity, 
he said he might as well tell me that he had most 
unpleasant if not painful information to give me. 
Being somewhat surprised at such an announce- 
ment, I asked what the information was. He said 
he had received from the viceroy of Fuhkein and 
Chehkiang an official despatch requesting him to 
have me arrested, if found in Formosa, and sent 
over to the mainland to be delivered over to the 
Chinese authorities. Kodama while giving this 
information showed neither perturbation of 
thought nor feeling, but his whole countenance 
was wreathed with a calm and even playful smile. 
I was not disturbed by this unexpected news, 
nor was I at all excited. I met it calmly and 
squarely, and said in reply that I was entirely in 
his power, that he could deliver me over to my 
enemies whenever he wished; I was ready to die 
for China at any time, provided that the death 
was an honorable one. 

"Well, Mr. Yung," said he, "I am not going 
to play the part of a constable for China, so 
you may rest at ease on this point. I shall not 
deliver you over to China. But I have another 
matter to call to your attention." I asked what 
it was. He immediately held up a Chinese news- 
paper before me, and asked who was the author 
of the proposition. Without the least hesi- 
tation. I told him I was the author of it. 
At the same time, to give emphasis to this 
open declaration, I put my opened right palm 
on my chest two or three times, which attracted 
the attention of everyone in the room, and caused 
a slight excitement among the Japanese officials 
present. 

I then said, "With Your Excellency's permission, 
I must beg to make one correction in 
the amount stated; instead of $800,000,000, the 
sum stated in my proposition was only $400,000,000." 
At this frank and open declaration 
and the corrected sum, Kodama was evidently 
pleased and visibly showed his pleasure by smiling at me. 

The Chinese newspaper Kodama showed me 
contained a proposition I drew up for Viceroy 
Chang Chi Tung to memorialize the Peking 
government for adoption in 1894-5, about six 
months before the signing of the Treaty of 
Shemonashiki by Viceroy Li Hung Chang. 
The proposal was to have the Island of Formosa 
mortgaged to a European Treaty power for a 
period of ninety-nine years for the sum of 
$400,000,000 in gold. With this sum China was 
to carry on the war with Japan by raising a new 
army and a new navy. This proposition was 
never carried through, but was made public in 
the Chinese newspapers, and a copy of it found 
its way to Kodama's office, where, strange to say, 
I was confronted with it, and I had the moral 
courage not only to avow its authorship but also 
a correction of the amount the island was to be 
mortgaged for. 

To bring the interview to a climax, I said, 
should like circumstances ever arise, nothing 
would deter me from repeating the same propo- 
sition in order to fight Japan. 

This interview with the Japanese governor of 
Formosa was one of the most memorable ones in 
my life. I thought at first that at the request of 
the Chinese viceroy I was going to be sur- 
rendered, and that my fate was sealed; but no 
sooner had the twinkling smile of Kodama 
lighted his countenance than my assurance of life 
and safety came back with redoubled strength, 
and I was emboldened to talk war on Japan with 
perfect impunity. The bold and open stand I 
took on that occasion won the admiration of the 
governor who then invited me to accompany him 
to Japan where he expected to go soon to 
be promoted. He said he would introduce me to 
the Japanese emperor and other leading men of 
the nation. I thanked him heartily for his 
kindness and invitation and said I would accept 
such a generous invitation and consider it a great 
honor to accompany him on his contemplated 
journey, but my health would not allow me to 
take advantage of it. I had the asthma badly 
at the time. 

Then, before parting, he said that my life was 
in danger, and that while I was in Formosa 
under his jurisdiction he would see that I was 
well protected and said that he would furnish 
me with a bodyguard to prevent all possibilities 
of assassination. So the next day he sent me 
four Japanese guards to watch over me at night 
in my quarters; and in the daytime whenever I 
went out, two guards would go in advance of 
me and two behind my jinrickisha to see that I 
was safe. This protection was continued for 
the few days I spent in Formosa till I em- 
barked for Hong Kong. I went in person to 
thank the governor and to express my great 
obligation and gratitude to him for the deep 
interest he had manifested towards me.

戊戌政变

一八九八年九月的政变，是满清王朝史上极具纪念意义的一件大事。在这场政变中，光绪皇帝被强行废黜，变为阶下囚，被囚禁为“国家囚徒”；他作为中华帝国皇帝的权力与特权被剥夺，并由慈禧太后所篡夺。

光绪虽然在五岁时即被立为皇帝，但自始至终只是名义上的执掌权杖。实则掌舵政权的，一直是慈禧。

当光绪年满成人、开始亲政之时，慈禧那双犀利的眼睛便未曾一刻从他身上移开。他的一举一动都被严密监视，而且往往被曲解为不当之举，因为慈禧自从1864年首次以母后之尊摄政统治其子同治帝以来，其在政权中的地位便一直非正统也不正当。自那时起，掌权欲便在她心中萌生，并迅速膨胀为一种病态的、无法遏制的统治激情。

当光绪皇帝以真正的男子汉气概主张亲政，行使君权、力图改革之际，他便立刻成为京城内外瞩目的焦点。而在慈禧太后看来——她的目光因篡权之事所蒙蔽，又被嫉妒所致盲——光绪简直如痴如狂；或者说得委婉些，也不过是个痴愚之人，唯一合适的下场便是被拴在围裙带上、予以看管照料。

但在一个冷静旁观、心无偏见的评判者眼中，光绪绝非痴愚，更非疯癫。公正的历史与后世子孙定会判定他不仅是一位爱国皇帝，更是一位思想健全、理智清明的爱国改革者，可比肩历代英明君主。他可谓满清王朝历史上极其卓越的人物——因其被冥冥之中的上天所拣选，成为二十世纪之初中国改革大潮的先驱者。

正当此时，中国的政治风潮也已涌入北京。光绪皇帝在某种神秘力量的感召之下，出人意料地挺身而出，成为改革运动的倡导者。这一举动震惊了整个世界。我决意留在京城，亲自观察改革的进展。我的寓所随即成为戊戌年间改革派领袖的聚集地。就在这记忆犹新的秋天，政变爆发：年少的光绪皇帝被慈禧太后废黜，部分改革领袖被逮捕，旋即遭到斩首处决。

我因庇护改革派、又与他们情感深厚而受到牵连，不得不为性命逃亡，并最终成功逃离北京。我在上海租界落脚。在那里，我组织成立了“中国议事会”，并被推举为首任会长。该会宗旨为讨论当时的重要议题，尤其以改革为要务。

1899年，有人劝我出于安全考虑迁居他地。于是我前往香港，接受英国政府的保护。

我自1900年起居于香港，至1902年返回美国，欲亲见我小儿子容式廷（Bartlett G. Yung）自耶鲁大学毕业。

1901年春，我曾前往台湾一游。在此次旅途中，我拜访了时任台湾总督的子爵儿玉源太郎。后者在1904至1905年的日俄战争中，担任大山元帅在满洲的总参谋长。我们的会谈必须借由翻译进行——因他不会讲英语，而我也不会讲日语。

他表示很高兴见到我，说早已久仰我的大名，只是无缘谋面。如今终于见面，他说自己必须转告一则不甚愉快、甚至令人痛苦的消息。此番突然声明令我颇感意外，便问其所为何事。他说，他收到福建与浙江总督联合发来的正式照会，要求他若发现我人在台湾，须将我逮捕并遣送回大陆，交由清廷处置。儿玉在转达此消息时既无情绪起伏，亦无冷峻之色，其脸上反倒挂着一丝温和甚至调皮的微笑。

我对于这突如其来的消息并未感到惊慌或激动，我平静而坚定地回应：我既落在他手中，若他愿意将我交给仇敌，我随时准备为中国而死，只要这死是光明磊落、合乎尊严的。

他答道：“容先生，我不会当中国的差役，所以您大可安心。我不会将您交给清廷。但我还有一事要请您说明。”我问何事。他便举起一份中文报纸，问其中提案的作者是谁。我毫不犹豫地答道：“是我。”同时，为强调自己的坦率，我用右手掌拍了拍胸口两三下，这一动作吸引了在场日本官员的注意，并引起了一丝轻微的骚动。

我接着说：“请容许我指出一点更正：报上所载金额为八亿金元，其实我的原提案金额仅为四亿金元。”听到我如此坦率地认领该提案，又进一步说明金额，儿玉显然十分欣赏，当即对我报以微笑以示赞许。

他所出示的这份中文报纸，载有我于1894至1895年间为张之洞总督拟写的一份上奏京廷的提案——时间是在《马关条约》签署前约半年。提案内容为：将台湾岛以九十九年为期，抵押给某一欧洲条约列强，以换取四亿金元。以此巨款，中国可筹建新陆军与海军，继续与日本作战。该提案未获采纳，后被公开刊登在中文报纸上，而其中一份竟辗转送到儿玉办公桌前。令人惊讶的是，我竟亲身于此被此提案所“当场对质”，而我也毫不犹豫地承认其为本人所作，甚至更正了金额。

为使此一对话达到高潮，我最后说道：“倘若有朝一日情势使然，我绝不会犹豫，再次提出同样的建议，以抗击日本。”

此次与日本台湾总督的会面，可谓我生涯中最值得纪念的一次经历。初听儿玉转述清廷通缉，我以为将被引渡，命运已定；但当他嘴角那抹笑意浮现时，我立刻意识到自己性命无忧，随即鼓起勇气，毫无顾忌地谈论起对日之战。我在这次会谈中展现的坚定与坦荡，赢得了儿玉的欣赏。他当场邀请我随他赴日本访问，他说即将赴日晋升，届时愿引荐我觐见天皇及日本政界要人。

我向他深表谢意，坦言此邀实属荣幸，并愿随行，但因当时我哮喘严重，健康不许，故无法成行。

临别时，他告诫我生命确实有危险，表示我在台湾逗留期间，他将亲自确保我的安全。他特派日警保护我，防止遭刺杀。翌日即派四名日本卫兵驻守我住所夜间安全；而白天我外出时，则有两人前导、两人尾随于我人力车旁，确保万无一失。这番保护持续至我离台赴香港之日。我亲赴总督官邸谢恩，表达我对他关怀之深的由衷感激。

第二十二章
戊戌政变

1898年9月的戊戌政变，在清王朝历史上留下了难以磨灭的印记。光绪皇帝被公然废黜，沦为阶下囚，其作为大清帝国君主的权力尽数被慈禧太后篡夺。

这位五岁登基的皇帝，虽早已成年亲政，却始终未能摆脱慈禧太后的操控。当光绪决意推行新政以彰显皇权时，那双在1864年垂帘听政时就被唤醒的权力欲望之眼，便以看待疯癫者的目光审视着他的一举一动。然在公正的历史评判下，这位立志改革的君主，实乃满清王朝最富远见的改革先驱。

值此历史关头，我选择留京观察变法进程。我的寓所成为维新志士的聚集地。在那难忘的秋天，政变猝发，光绪被囚，六君子喋血菜市口。因藏匿维新党人而遭牵连的我，只得仓皇逃离京城，避居上海租界，并组建"中国议会"以探讨改革之道。

1899年为避祸移居香港。1901年春游历台湾时，拜会了儿玉源太郎总督。这位日后日俄战争中的满洲军总参谋长，竟出示闽浙总督要求引渡我的公文。面对生死威胁，我坦然承认自己正是当年"抵押台湾筹款四亿两抗倭"方案的提出者，并直言若情势所需，仍将重提此议以抗日本。这番胆识赢得儿玉赏识，他不仅拒绝引渡，更派兵日夜护卫，直至我安全离台。

（注："喋血菜市口"化用谭嗣同"我自横刀向天笑"典故；"四亿两"数据保留原文细节；末段儿玉派兵护卫的戏剧性场景强化人物形象）
