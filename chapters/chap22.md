CHAPTER XXII 
THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 

The coup d'etat of September, 1898, was an 
event memorable in the annals of the Manchu 
Dynasty. In it, the late Emperor Kwang Su 
was arbitrarily deposed; treasonably made a 
prisoner of state; and had his prerogatives and 
rights as Emperor of the Chinese Empire 
wrested from him and usurped by the late 
Dowager Empress Chi HsL 

Kwang Su, though crowned Emperor when 
he was five years of age, had all along held the 
sceptre only nominally. It was Chi Hsi who 
held the helm of the government all the time. 

As soon as Kwang Su had attained his ma- 
jority, and began to exercise his authority as 
emperor, the lynx eye of Chi Hsi was never 
lifted away from him. His acts and movements 
were watched with the closest scrutiny, and were 
looked upon in any light but the right one, 
because her own stand in the government had 
never been the legitimate and straight one since 

1864, when her first regency over her own son,

Tung Chi, woke in her an ambition to dominate 
and rule, which grew to he a passion too morhid 
and strong to be curbed. 

In the assertion of his true manhood, and the 
exercise of his sovereign power, his determina- 
tion to reform the government made him at once 
the cynosure of Peking, inside and outside of 
the Palace, In the eyes of the Dowager Em- 
press Chi Hsi, whose retina was darkened by 
deeds perpetrated in the interest of usurpation 
and blinded by jealousy, Kwang Su appeared in 
no other light than as a dement, or to use a milder 
expression, an imbecile, fit only to be tagged 
round by an apron string, cared for and watched. 
But to the disinterested spectator and unpreju- 
diced judge, Kwan Su was no imbecile, much 
less a dement. Impartial history and posterity 
will pronounce him not only a patriot emperor, 
but also a patriot reformer as mentally sound and 
sane as any emperor who ever sat on the throne 
of China. He may be looked upon as a most 
remarkable historical character of the Manchu 
Dynasty from the fact that he was singled out 
by an all-wise Providence to be the pioneer of 
the great reform movement in China at the 
threshold of the twentieth century. 

Just at this juncture of the political condition 



THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 

of China, the tide of reform had reached Peking. 
Emperor Kwang Su, under some mysterious in- 
fluence, to the astonishment of the world, stood 
forth as the exponent of this reform movement. 
I determined to remain in the city to watch its 
progress. My headquarters became the rendez- 
vous of the leading reformers of 1898. It was in 
the fall of that memorable year that the coup 
d'etat took place, in which the young Emperor 
Kwang Su was deposed by the Dowager 
Empress, and some of the leading reformers 
arrested and summarily decapitated. 

Being implicated by harboring the reformers, 
and in deep sympathy with them, I had to flee 
for my own life and succeeded in escaping from 
Peking. I took up quarters in the foreign set- 
tlement of Shanghai. While there, I organized 
the "Deliberative Association of China," of 
which I was chosen the first president. The 
object of the association was to discuss the lead- 
ing question of the day, especially those of re- 
form. 

In 1899, I was advised for my own personal 
safety, to change my residence. I went to Hong 
Kong and placed myself under the protection of 
the British government. 

I was in Hong Kong from 1900 till 1902, 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

when I returned to the United States to see my 
younger son, Bartlett G. Yung, graduate from 
Yale University* 

In the spring of 1901, I visited the Island of 
Formosa, and in that visit I called upon Vis- 
count Gentaro Kodama, governor of the island, 
who, in the Russo-Japan War of 1904-5 was 
the chief of staff to Marshal Oyama in Man- 
churia. In the interview our conversation had 
to be carried on through his interpreter, as he, 
Kodama, could not speak English nor could I 
speak Japanese. 

He said he was glad to see me, as he had heard 
a great deal of me, but never had the pleasure of 
meeting me. Now that he had the opportuity, 
he said he might as well tell me that he had most 
unpleasant if not painful information to give me. 
Being somewhat surprised at such an announce- 
ment, I asked what the information was. He said 
he had received from the viceroy of Fuhkein and 
Chehkiang an official despatch requesting him to 
have me arrested, if found in Formosa, and sent 
over to the mainland to be delivered over to the 
Chinese authorities. Kodama while giving this 
information showed neither perturbation of 
thought nor feeling, but his whole countenance 
was wreathed with a calm and even playful smile. 



THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 243 

I was not disturbed by this unexpected news, 
nor was I at all excited. I met it calmly and 
squarely, and said in reply that I was entirely in 
his power, that he could deliver me over to my 
enemies whenever he wished; I was ready to die 
for China at any time, provided that the death 
was an honorable one. 

"Well, Mr. Yung," said he, "I am not going 
to play the part of a constable for China, so 
you may rest at ease on this point. I shall not 
deliver you over to China. But I have another 
matter to call to your attention." I asked what 
it was. He immediately held up a Chinese news- 
paper before me, and asked who was the author 
of the proposition. Without the least hesi- 
tation. I told him I was the author of it. 
At the same time, to give emphasis to this 
open declaration, I put my opened right palm 
on my chest two or three times, which attracted 
the attention of everyone in the room, and caused 
a slight excitement among the Japanese officials 
present. 

I then said, "With Your Excellency's per- 
mission, I must beg to make one correction in 
the amount stated; instead of $800,000,000, the 
sum stated in my proposition was only $400,- 
000,000." At this frank and open declaration 



244 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and the corrected sum, Kodama was evidently 
pleased and visibly showed his pleasure by smil- 
ing at me. 

The Chinese newspaper Kodama showed me 
contained a proposition I drew up for Viceroy 
Chang Chi Tung to memorialize the Peking 
government for adoption in 1894-5, about six 
months before the signing of the Treaty of 
Shemonashiki by Viceroy Li Hung Chang. 
The proposal was to have the Island of Formosa 
mortgaged to a European Treaty power for a 
period of ninety-nine years for the sum of 
$400,000,000 in gold. With this sum China was 
to carry on the war with Japan by raising a new 
army and a new navy. This proposition was 
never carried through, but was made public in 
the Chinese newspapers, and a copy of it found 
its way to Kodama's office, where, strange to say, 
I was confronted with it, and I had the moral 
courage not only to avow its authorship but also 
a correction of the amount the island was to be 
mortgaged for. 

To bring the interview to a climax, I said, 
should like circumstances ever arise, nothing 
would deter me from repeating the same propo- 
sition in order to fight Japan. 

This interview with the Japanese governor of 



THE COUP D'ETAT OF 1898 245 

Formosa was one of the most memorable ones in 
my life. I thought at first that at the request of 
the Chinese viceroy I was going to be sur- 
rendered, and that my fate was sealed; but no 
sooner had the twinkling smile of Kodama 
lighted his countenance than my assurance of life 
and safety came back with redoubled strength, 
and I was emboldened to talk war on Japan with 
perfect impunity. The bold and open stand I 
took on that occasion won the admiration of the 
governor who then invited me to accompany him 
to Japan where he expected to go soon to 
be promoted. He said he would introduce me to 
the Japanese emperor and other leading men of 
the nation. I thanked him heartily for his 
kindness and invitation and said I would accept 
such a generous invitation and consider it a great 
honor to accompany him on his contemplated 
journey, but my health would not allow me to 
take advantage of it. I had the asthma badly 
at the time. 

Then, before parting, he said that my life was 
in danger, and that while I was in Formosa 
under his jurisdiction he would see that I was 
well protected and said that he would furnish 
me with a bodyguard to prevent all possibilities 
of assassination. So the next day he sent me 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

four Japanese guards to watch over me at night 
in my quarters; and in the daytime whenever I 
went out, two guards would go in advance of 
me and two behind my jinrickisha to see that I 
was safe. This protection was continued for 
the few days I spent in Formosa till I em- 
barked for Hong Kong. I went in person to 
thank the governor and to express my great 
obligation and gratitude to him for the deep 
interest he had manifested towards me.
