APPENDIX 

An address by the Rev. Joseph H. Twichell, delivered 
before the Kent Club of the Yale Law School, April 10, 
1878. 

A visitor to the City of Hartford, at the pres- 
ent time, will be likely to meet on the streets 
groups of Chinese boys, in their native dress, 
though somewhat modified, and speaking their 
native tongue, yet seeming, withal, to be very 
much at home. He will also occasionally meet 
Chinese men who, by their bearing, will impress 
him as being gentlemen of their race. 

These gentlemen are officers, and these boys 
are pupils of the Chinese Educational Mission, 
although one of the most remarkable and signifi- 
cant institutions of the age on the face of the 
whole earth. The object of the mission, now of 
nearly six years' standing, is the education in 
this country, through a term of fifteen years, of 
a corps of young men for the Chinese Govern- 
ment service; that Government paying the whole 
cost an annual expense of about $100,000. The 
number of the officers is five, viz, the two Im- 
perial Commissioners in charge, a translator and 
interpreter and two teachers. The function of 
the teachers is to direct the Chinese education of 
the pupils, which proceeds pan passu with their 
Western education. The number of pupils was 
originally 120, but now 112, one having died 
and seven having, for various reasons, returned 
to China. A fine, large house recently erected 
by the Chinese Government in the western part 
of the City, at a cost of fifty thousand dollars, 
is the headquarters of the Mission. There are 
the offices of the officers, and there is lodged the 
class that is present for examination and instruc- 
tion in Chinese studies. For this purpose the 
pupils are divided into classes of about twenty, 
one coming as another goes, each staying at the 
Mission House two weeks at a time. A small 
part only of the whole number are permanently 
located in Hartford. Most of them are in other 
places, though not far away, generally two to- 
gether -attending school or receiving private in- 
struction in families. 

They come in yearly companies of thirty, be- 
ginning with 1872, and the last detachment is 
still chiefly engaged in learning our language. 

The plan is to afford these boys the advantages 
of our best educational institutions academies, 
colleges, and, to some extent, professional schools 
to assign them, by and by, as they shall develop 
aptitude, to various special courses of study and 
training in the physical, mechanical and military 
sciences, in political history and economy, inter- 
national law, the principles and practice of civil 
administration and in all departments and 
branches of knowledge, skill in which is useful 
for public government service in these modern 
times. And through the whole process of this 
education, it is to be impressed upon them that 
they belong and are to belong to their nation, 
for whose sake they are elected to enjoy these 
great and peculiar opportunities. The result 
will be, if all goes well and the plan is carried 
out, and there is apparently nothing now to 
prevent it, that in the year 1887 or thereabout 
there will go from this country to China a body 
of somewhere near a hundred men who have 
grown up under exceedingly favorable condi- 
tions from early youth to manhood here among 
us, destined to hold places of importance in the 
government and in the society of their native 
land, better equipped in all save experience to 
do for that land what most needs to be done, 
and inspired for their work with a more enlight- 
ened sense of patriotic duty and responsibility 
than any other hundred of her sons of their 
generation. And who can forecast or estimate 
the consequences that Divine Providence is thus 
preparing? 

COMMISSIONER YUNG WING 

Such in brief outline is the Chinese Educa- 
tional Mission to the United States. The head 
and front of the whole marvellous enterprise, 
humanly speaking, is Commissioner Yung Wing. 
While others whose cooperation was indispensa- 
ble, have, as will presently appear, contributed 
to it and still stand back of it, and justly share 
the credit of it with him, to him more than to 
any other man beside, probably more than to 
all other men beside, its existence is due. Its 
history, thus far, cannot be better told except in 
that connection, so intimately -are the two his- 
tories related. But it becomes one who speaks 
of Yung Wing to observe the principle that we 
must be modest for a modest man, for so modest 
a man as he is is rare to find. He was born in 
1828, of a worthy family in humble life, near the 
city of Macao in Southern China. In the year 
1839 he became a pupil in a children's school, 
opened by Mrs. Gutzlaff, the wife of an English 
missionary, his parents consenting to it in the 
idea that it would be a profitable thing for him to 
learn the English language. Proving a bright 
scholar, he was in time promoted to the Morrison 
School, an institution founded by English mer- 
chants in Macao and named after Robert Morri- 
son, the first English Protestant, but at this 
time under charge of the Rev. S. R. Brown, a 
teacher engaged by the Morrison Educational 
Society. When later this school was transferred 
to Hong Kong he went with it, and remained 
in it till he came to this country. He suffered, 
however, during this time serious interruption by 
the death of his father, which required him to 
go home and, a boy that he was, assist in the 
support of his family. This he did by wages 
earned in the printing establishment of a Portu- 
guese Roman Catholic mission in Macao. 

In 1847, Mr. Brown, who had long noted his 
patient ardor in study, the marks of ability he 
showed and a certain original vigor of will and 
strength of character that were in him, brought 
him, at the age of sixteen, with two other native 
lads, also his pupils, of about the same age, to 
the United States; Andrew Shortrede, a large- 
hearted Scotchman, founder, proprietor and edi- 
tor of The China Mail, published at Hong 
Kong, engaging to advance the means of their 
support for two years. The three boys were 
entered together at the academy in Monson, 
Mass., and were received into the family of Mr. 
Brown's mother, who lived at Monson, a royal 
woman whose name is memorable in the church 
of Christ as that of the author of the hymn, "I 
love to steal awhile away." It was while a member 
of her godly household that Yung Wing 
became a Christian believer. 

It will not be out of place to state here, as a 
fact, the significance of which will be readily 
appreciated, that he caused the son who was born 
to him in 1876 his first-born to be named in 
baptism Morrison Brown, an eloquent act of 
recognition and profession. Of Wing's two com- 
panions one, Wong Shing, was compelled, by 
want of health, to return to China the next year. 
There, in the office of The China Mail,, he 
learned the art of printing. From 1852 or 1853 
he was for several years connected with the press 
of the London Mission under Dr. Legge, now 
the eminent Professor of the Chinese Language 
and Literature in Oxford University. In 1873 
he accompanied the second detachment of 
Chinese students to this country, and is at present 
under appointment as interpreter to the 
Chinese Legation soon to be established at Washington. 

The other, Wong Fun, went to Scotland in 
1850, and after two years general study entered 
the Medical Department of Edinburgh Univer- 
sity, at which he graduated with very high honor. 
Returning to China in 1856, he hegan the prac- 
tice of medicine in the city of Canton and is most 
highly esteemed on all that coast, both for his 
private character and for his professional talents, 
being held by many foreign residents the ablest 
physician in the whole region of the East beyond 
Calcutta. Wong Fun died Oct. 15th, 1878. 

IN YALE COLLEGE 

Yung Wing, after two years and a half spent 
iat Monson, Mass., was, in 1850, though but 
poorly fitted for want of time, admitted to the 
Freshman Class in Yale College. His career in 
college was, in some respects, a remarkable one. 
Owing to his inadequate preparations, he did not, 
though he worked hard, take a high stand in 
general scholarship, yet he excelled in the de- 
partments of writing and metaphysics, and 
made a sensation that was felt beyond the col- 
lege walls by bearing off repeated prizes for 
English composition. Throughout his entire 
course he contended with poverty, a circumstance 
the explanation of which deserves notice. When 
he became a Christian, at Monson, he heard and 
at once accepted his Divine call to devote his 
life to the Christian service of his nation. But 
the form of that service what should it he? 
This question he had to answer, at least in part. 
The presumption was, and it was assumed by 
Ms friends and by the public so far as his case 
was known, that he would be a minister of the 
Gospel. But right then and there, after much 
careful and prayerful thinking, this boy of 
seventeen, though by no means doubting the 
value of Christian missions, fully recognizing 
the fact, indeed, that he himself was the direct 
fruit of Christian missions, which, be it ever 
remembered, he was, concluded, with an inde- 
pendence characteristic of him even at that age, 
that it was not best for him to be a missionary. 
He had a suspicion then, though indistinct, that 
he was wanted for something else. It was a 
costly conclusion and he was quite aware of it. 
It was against the views and hopes of the most 
of those who were around him, and by it, being 
without pecuniary means, he cut himself off from 
the resource of those charitable foundations that 
would have aided him as a student for the minis- 
try. And so he was poor in college; he smiles 
now to remember how poor. Yet he received 
help from persons interested in him; at New 
Haven and elsewhere, mainly through the 
medium of Professor Thatcher,, whose care for 
him in that matter claims his liveliest gratitude 
to this day. And he got through. He came to 
college in his cue and Chinese tunic, hut put off 
both in the course of his first year. 

His nationality made him a good deal of a 
stranger, and this, together with his extreme 
natural reserve and his poverty, kept him from 
mingling much with the social life of college. 
He had not many intimates, yet he so carried 
himself from first to last as to merit and win the 
entire respect of all his class. It was in certain 
long walks and talks he had with his classmate, 
Carrol Cutler, now president of Western Re- 
serve College, that he opened and discussed the 
project then forming in his mind of this Chinese 
Educational Mission. The idea was born, the 
dream was taking shape, but the way was long 
to its realization. 

His graduation in 1854 was the event of the 
Commencement of that year. There were many, 
at least, who so regarded it, and some of them 
came to the Commencement principally for the 
sake of seeing the Chinese graduate. Among 
the latter was Dr. Bushnell of Hartford. He 
had heard of him and being strongly interested, 
according to the size of his great mind and heart, 
in the Chinese race, he desired to meet Yung 
Wing. An incident of their meeting on that 
occasion, which the writer has heard Dr. Bush- 
nell tell, will bear repeating: When they were 
introduced, the Doctor gave it as one of his 
reasons for seeking the introduction that he de- 
sired to ascertain who had written certain news- 
paper articles on the Chinese question, as it then 
stood, which had attracted his attention as evinc- 
ing marks of statesmanship. He thought Wing 
might know. Whereupon, as the Doctor said, 
Wing hung his head, and blushing like a girl, 
with much confusion of manner, confessed that 
he was their author. It is only fair to add that 
Mr, Wing says that he does not remember this 
incident. But it is equally fair to add again 
that in a case of this kind Dr. BushnelTs memory, 
or anybody else's, were more worthy to be 
trusted than Yung Wing's. 



附录

约瑟夫·H·特威切尔牧师于1878年4月10日，在耶鲁大学法学院肯特俱乐部的演讲。

一位今日造访哈特福德市的来客，很可能会在街头看到一群群中国少年，身穿虽略作改良但依旧可辨识的中国服饰，讲着中文，却显得极为自在。他偶尔也会遇到几位中国男子，他们的风度足以令人感受到身为中华绅士的涵养。

这些绅士是官员，而这些少年则是中国留美幼童教育计划（Chinese Educational Mission）的学生——这是当今世界上最引人瞩目、意义非凡的教育机构之一。该计划至今已推行近六年，目标是在美国培养一批为中国政府服务的年轻人才，整个教育周期为十五年。中国政府承担全部费用，每年支出约十万美元。该计划设有五位官员，即两位主管的钦差大臣、一位翻译兼口译员，以及两位中文教师。中文教师的职责是指导学生的中国传统学业，使其与西方教育同步进行。

最初招收的学生共120人，如今为112人，一人不幸去世，另有七人因种种原因返回中国。中国政府在哈特福德市西部新建一栋宏伟的宅邸，耗资五万美元，作为教育使团的总部。官员办公于此，轮值接受中文考试和学习的学生亦在此居住。学生被分为约二十人一组，轮流来此，每组停留两周。常驻哈特福德的学生只是少数，大多数则被分派到附近地区，一般以两人为单位，就读学校或寄居于当地家庭接受私人教育。

学生自1872年起每年分批来美，每批约三十人，最新一批仍在努力学习英语中。

本计划旨在让这些少年能接受美国最优质的教育资源——从中学、大学，乃至某些专业学校，并在他们逐渐展露才华后，引导其进入更为专业的领域学习，如自然科学、机械与军事技术、政治历史与经济、国际法、行政管理原则与实践，以及一切对现代国家治理有用的知识与技能。整个教育过程中，将不断强化他们对祖国的归属感，使其始终铭记，他们之所以能享有此等非凡机遇，正是为了服务中华民族。

若一切顺利，计划得以贯彻实施，眼下也看不出有任何障碍，那么到了1887年前后，将有近百名自少年时期起就在此间优越环境中成长起来的青年，返回中国，走上政府与社会的要职。他们虽缺乏实战经验，却在知识技能方面准备充分，更重要的是，他们将怀抱比同代任何百位国人更清明、更深刻的爱国责任感与使命感。而由此带来的深远影响，是唯有上帝的安排方能预见与衡量的。

容闳钦差

上述简要概述的正是中国留美幼童教育计划。而这一令人称奇的伟大工程，其核心人物、发起者，若从人事角度而言，正是容闳钦差。虽有他人协助不可或缺，贡献良多，至今仍在幕后支持，并理应与他共享荣耀，但若论此计划的肇始与存续，容闳的功劳超过任何一人，或可说，超过所有其他人的总和。这一计划的历史，与他的个人经历息息相关，难以分开叙述。

然而谈及容闳时，我们必须遵循一个原则：替谦逊的人保持谦逊。如此谦逊之人，实属罕见。

容闳生于1828年，家境清寒，祖籍靠近中国南方的澳门城。1839年，他成为英国传教士郭士立（Gutzlaff）夫人开设的儿童学校的学生，他的父母之所以同意，是觉得学英语对他将来有益。他天资聪颖，成绩优异，不久便升入“马礼逊学校”，这是由英国商人在澳门设立的教育机构，以英国首位来华传教士罗伯特·马礼逊命名。该校当时由莫理循教育会聘请的美籍教师布朗（Rev. S. R. Brown）担任校长。

后来学校迁至香港，他亦随校同行。但在学业期间，因父亲去世，不得不中断学业，返回家中，年纪尚幼便开始为生计奔波。他在澳门一所葡萄牙天主教传教机构的印刷厂工作，以工读维生。

1847年，布朗先生长期观察他勤奋刻苦的求学精神、展现的才智与个性中所蕴含的坚毅与独立，决定将他带往美国。当时他年方十六，同行的还有两名中国少年，皆为布朗的学生。此行所需费用，由一位心胸宽广的苏格兰人安德鲁·肖特里德（Andrew Shortrede）慷慨资助。他是《中外日报》（The China Mail）的创办人、发行人兼主编。

三人一同进入马萨诸塞州蒙森学院（Monson Academy），寄居于布朗母亲家中。这位女士虔诚敬主，在基督教界享有盛誉，正是《我爱片刻幽静祷告》（“I love to steal awhile away”）这首圣诗的作者。容闳正是在这位敬虔母亲的家庭中，皈依基督信仰。

此处不妨顺带一提，这一事实的象征意义无需赘述。容闳于1876年迎来长子，为其命名为“马礼逊·布朗”（Morrison Brown），既是纪念之举，亦是信仰与感恩的表达。

同行的两位伙伴，一位王星（Wong Shing），次年因健康不佳被迫返华，在《中外日报》学得印刷技艺。自1852或1853年起，他在李雅各博士领导下，任职于伦敦会印刷部数年。李博士如今已是牛津大学著名的汉学教授。1873年，王星陪同第二批幼童赴美，如今已被任命为即将在华盛顿设立的中国公使馆的译员。

另一位王芬（Wong Fun），于1850年前往苏格兰，接受两年通识教育后进入爱丁堡大学医学院，成绩优异，顺利毕业。1856年返抵广州行医，德才兼备，声望极高，连不少外籍人士亦称他为加尔各答以东最杰出的华人医生。王芬卒于1878年10月15日。

在耶鲁大学

容闳在蒙森学院读了两年半，虽因学业准备不足仍较勉强，仍于1850年被耶鲁大学录取为新生。他在耶鲁的经历，在许多方面颇具传奇色彩。由于基础薄弱，他在整体成绩上并不拔尖，虽用功甚勤，但在英文写作与形上学方面表现突出，屡获英文作文奖，引起校内外关注。

在大学期间，他始终与贫困为伍，值得一提的是，导致他经济拮据的缘由颇具意义。他在蒙森信主后，即立志一生为基督服务，然而，这项使命该以何种形式体现？这个问题他必须作出决定。众人都认为他将成为传教士，而这一设想也合乎逻辑。但就在那时，这位年仅十七岁的少年，在虔诚祷告与深思熟虑之后，虽然并未否认传教事业的价值，也完全认同自己正是传教成果的产物，仍毅然决然地认为，自己并不适合成为传教士。他依稀感到自己肩负着另一种使命。这个抉择代价高昂，他心知肚明。周围的大多数人对此表示失望，而由于他无力承担学费，又不能申请神学院慈善资助，因此在耶鲁过得极为清贫。如今他笑谈自己当年有多“穷”。尽管如此，他还是得到了不少人的资助，尤其是塞切尔教授（Professor Thatcher），一直在财务上关照他，对此他至今心存感激。最终，他顺利完成学业。他是扎着长辫、穿着中国袍服来到大学的，但入学一年后便剪去了辫子，换上西服。

由于其特殊的国籍身份、与生俱来的内向性格以及贫困处境，他在校园社交生活中相对孤立。朋友虽不多，却始终赢得全班同学的尊敬。他与同班同学卡罗尔·卡特勒（Carrol Cutler，后任西储大学校长）经常结伴散步，交谈深入，正是在这些谈话中，他首次向人道出中国留美教育计划的构想。这个想法已然诞生，梦想正在成形，但离其实现尚有漫长之路。

1854年他从耶鲁毕业，那年的毕业典礼因他而成为盛事。许多人认为他才是那场典礼的主角，其中不少人仅为一睹这位中国毕业生的风采而来。哈特福德的布什内尔博士（Dr. Bushnell）便是其中一人。他早已耳闻其名，而他本人又极关心中国人，既怀好奇亦存敬意，故特意前来拜会容闳。

布什内尔博士曾讲述两人初次见面的趣事，值得一提。他表示想认识容闳的一个原因，是想查明几篇关于中国问题的报刊文章的作者身份。那几篇文章写得颇具见地，体现出政治家的眼光。他怀疑容闳可能知道是谁写的。结果，正如他所说，容闳听后低下头，脸红如霞，羞涩万分，最后才承认那些文章出自自己之手。容闳本人后来称不记得有此事，但在这种场合下，布什内尔博士或任何人所记，恐怕比容闳自己的记忆更可信。





At the time of his graduation, Wing was as 
much tempted as it was possible for him to be, 
to change the plan of his life. He had been in 
this country long enough to becom'e thoroughly 
naturalized here. He was, in fact, a citizen. All 
his tastes and feelings and affinities, intellectual 
and moral, made him at home here. Moreover, 
through the notice into which his graduation 
brought him, it came about that a very inviting 
opportunity was opened to him to remain and 
have his career here if he chose to. On the other 
hand, China was like a strange land to him. He 
had even almost entirely forgotten his native 
tongue. And there was nothing in China for 
him to go to. Except among his humble kindred, 
he had no friends there; nothing to give him any 
standing or consideration, no place, so to speak, 
to set his foot on. Not only so, but considering 
where he had been and what he had become, and 
the purpose he had in view, he could not fail to 
encounter, among his own people, prejudice, 
suspicion, hostility. A cheerless, forbidding 
prospect lay before him in that direction. The 
thought of going back was the thought of exile. 
He wanted immensely to stay. But there was 
one text of Holy Scripture that, all this while, 
he says, haunted Mm and followed him like the 
voice of God. It was this: "If any provide not 
for his own, and specially for those of his own 
house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than 
an infidel." And by the words "his own" and 
"his own house," it meant to him the nation of 
which he was born. The text carried the day. 
The benefits which he had been, as it were, 
singled out from a whole people to receive, his 
sense of justice and gratitude alike would not 
let him appropriate to his own advantage. And 
so, though he knew not what should befall him, 
he set his face to return; and he went to do what 
he has done. 

He sailed soon after his graduation for Hong 
Kong which, after a voyage of 151 days, he 
reached in the month of April, 1855. When the 
Chinese pilot came on board he found that he 
could, with some difficulty, understand what he 
said, though he could not make the pilot under- 
stand him, which shows the condition of his 
knowledge of Chinese on his arrival in the 
country. It took him! all the time he was not 
otherwise employed for two years to acquire 
facility in the use of it. 

TAKING FIRST STEPS IN LIFE 

As for his grand scheme, he had settled it in 
his own mind that the first step to be taken 
toward carrying it out was to contrive a way 
of getting it before some influential public man 
or men a thing itself of infinite difficulty. 
With this end in view, though, of course, to make 
his living also, he sought and obtained the posi- 
tion of private secretary to the Hon. Peter Par- 
ker, then Commissioner of the United States to 
China, hoping that it would be the means of 
affording him the access he desired. Becoming 
satisfied upon a sufficient trial that it was not 
likely to answer his expectations in this regard, 
he resigned the place after a few months. He 
now attempted another way of compassing the 
matter. There was at Hong Kong an English 
bar consisting of a dozen or so lawyers doing 
business for the foreign commercial houses of 
that City. Wing bethought him that the stand- 
ing and acquaintance resulting from his becom- 
ing a member of that bar might not improbably 
bring him the opportunity he sought. Accord- 
ingly, he entered one of the offices as a student. 
But presently it got out among the lawyers who 
this young man was, what his education had 
been, and they saw that his competition with 
them for legal practice of a Chinese city was a 
thing not to be allowed if it could be prevented. 
And so his principal, pleading the commands 
of his legal brethren, informed him, with many 
courteous expressions of regret, that he must 
find another place to study law in. And as 
there was no other place, he had to give it up. 

After this followed an interval of nearly two 
years, during which he occupied himself with 
Chinese and other studies, earning his bread by 
such commercial translation as he could find to 
do, and waited for the right thing to turn up. 
He then, in the same hope that led him to his 
previous experiments, took a place in the Cus- 
toms Service at Shanghai. But neither did this, 
on trial, promise, in his judgment, a pou sto 
for his operations, and he soon abandoned it. 

It was now 1860. Five years and nothing 
accomplished! To one only looking on the out- 
side Yung Wing would appear to have thus 
far pursued an uncertain and rather thriftless 
course; but not if he penetrated his real policy 
and the purpose that lay ever nearest his heart; 
most assuredly not if he knew what was the 
fact that all this time that he was going from 
one thing to another and keeping himself poor, 
he was refusing offers of employment at rates 
of remuneration that to him, so long familiar 
with a straightened lot, seemed little short of 
princely. In 1860, however, overtures were 
made him by one of the leading silk and tea 
houses of Shanghai to enter its service as traveling 
inland agent, which, for the reason in part 
that it would send him touring through a wide 
extent of country and possess him, by observa- 
tion, of a knowledge that he deemed would be 
useful to him, he determined to accept. This 
business he followed for a year, and then, seeing 
a good chance for it, set up in a business for 
himself which proved so profitable a venture that, 
had he continued in it, he would, to all appear- 
ances, have speedily become rich. As it was, he 
made a very considerable sum of money.

But in 1862 the door of the opportunity which 
he had been constantly feeling after from the 
day he landed in China, unexpectedly opened to 
him. 

It was in this wise: While in the city of 
Shanghai, he made the acquaintance of a Chinese 
astronomer a man of rank and of eminence in 
learning. Or rather, the astronomer, who had 
in some way gained intelligence of Wing's ante- 
cedents, sought his acquaintance for the sake of 
talking astronomy with him. In repeated inter- 
views through which their acquaintance pro- 
gressed to the degree of mutual friendly regard, 
Wing, who had carried away from college a 
better knowledge of astronomy than most gradu- 
ates do, told him all he knew, which was a long 
advance upon his own previous acquisitions in 
that science. This astronomer was an officer of 
the great Tsang Kwoh Fan, viceroy of Kiang Su 
and Kiang Nan provinces, generalissimo of the 
Imperial forces and one of the very most promi- 
nent and leading men in the whole Empire. 
Through representations made to him by the 
astronomer, he soon sent a message to Yung 
Wing desiring to see him, and hinting a desire to 
take him into his service. Though returning a 
favorable reply to the message, under all the 
circumstances and for reasons that cannot be 
explained, Wing delayed responding to it in 
person for a considerable time. The situation 
was a delicate one, requiring extreme caution 
and circumspection on his part. 

But at length he paid Tsang Koh Fan the 
promised visit. He felt the occasion to be a 
critical one, and when ushered into the great 
man's presence found it difficult to retain his 
composure. Tsang Koh Fan first bent upon 
him a long, intense, piercing gaze. As Wing 
says, he had never been looked at in his life as 
he was then. Then causing him to be seated, he 
required of him an account of his history, which 
he gave. He then questioned him as to his views 
respecting China, her needs, her outlook, her 
public policy, and so on. A long conversation 
followed in which the Viceroy disclosed his views, 
to which Wing listened with amazement. For, 
behold, here was a man such as he had not sup- 
posed existed in that country a man reared in 
China, and not a young man either who had 
light in his head; who recognized the causes of 
many of the disadvantages China was contending 
with in taking her place among the family of 
nations; a man of marvellously liberal and pro- 
gressive sentiments. 

MADE A MANDARIN 

The result of the interview was that Wing 
entered his service and was made a Mandarin 
of the fifth rank, there being nine degrees of that 
dignity in the Chinese official system, At this 
time the great Taiping rebellion was at its height 
and Tsang Koh Fan was in the field. In fact, 
the interview had taken place at his camp in 
Ngankin, on the Yang Tse River, The Viceroy 
first tendered Wing a military command which, 
on the score of lack of qualification, he asked 
leave to decline. He was then, shortly after, 
1864, at his own suggestion, despatched abroad 
to purchase machinery for the manufacture of 
arms, for which purpose the expenditure of a 
large sum of money was intrusted to him. On 
this errand he visited France and England as 
well as the United States, but finally gave his 
orders here. On returning with his purchases 
to China in 1865, what he had done was so satis- 
factory to his chief that he was advanced to the 
next higher grade of official rank, viz, the 
Fourth. The machinery he had bought was the 
foundation of the Kiang Nan Arsenal. It is 
curious to remark that the first work of a man 
whose supreme ambition it was, from Christian 
motives, to set his country forward in civilization, 
should have been the establishment of an arsenaL 
But it quite consisted with Yung Wing's ideas, 
which were intensely patriotic. 

From 1865 to 1870 he was variously employed 
in different places, being under command now 
of one superior and now of another. Among 
the work that he did during this period, that of 
translation was prominent. He translated into 
Chinese Parson's Law of Contracts, and a book 
of English Law. He also translated large por- 
tions of Colton's Geography, deeming that 
geographical knowledge was as likely to prove 
beneficial to his countrymen as any. 

But the thing that lay nearest his heart and 
that was continually before him, was the question 
of how to accomplish the plan he had so many 
years held in hope. He now had ample oppor- 
tunity to expound and advocate it, and he did 
so with inexhaustible perseverance. The main 
argument he used was this : China, in her inter- 
national relations, in her commercial and other 
intercourse with foreign peoples, suffers disad- 
vantage and much detriment from want of men 
capable by education of acting as her representa- 
tives. She is forced to employ in many most 
important places, that ought to be occupied by 
her own citizens, foreigners by whom her inter- 
ests are liable to be neglected or betrayed. Her 
forts, her ships of war, her military forces, her 
customs, are largely in charge of foreigners. 
How was it proper, he asked, that Anson Bur- 
lingame, an American, should be her chief agent 
in arranging a treaty with his own country and 
other western governments? This was his gen- 
eral line of reasoning. 



在他毕业之际，荣公曾一度受到极大诱惑，几乎改变了自己的人生计划。他在美国生活的时间已足够长，完全融入了当地社会。他事实上已是美国公民。他的品味、情感、以及智力和道德倾向，使他觉得美国才是他的家。再加上毕业后所受到的公众关注，为他在美国发展事业提供了一个极具吸引力的机会，只要他愿意，完全可以留下来。但相对地，中国对他而言却如同异乡。他几乎已将母语完全遗忘。在中国，他几乎无处可归。除了那些地位卑微的亲属外，他在中国没有朋友，没有能使他立足的身份或地位，可以说是“无地立足”。不仅如此，考虑到他曾经待过哪里、已经成为什么样的人，以及他怀抱的理想，在国人眼中他必然要面对偏见、猜忌和敌意。在那方向上，前路阴冷、令人却步。回国对他而言，就像是被放逐。他非常想留下来。但他说，有一段《圣经》的经文一直萦绕于心，仿佛上帝的声音在耳边回响。这段经文是：“人若不看顾亲属，就是背了真道，比不信的人还不好。”他把“亲属”和“本家”理解为生他养他的民族。这句话最终战胜了一切。他所获得的恩泽，是从整个民族中被拣选出来享受的，他的正义感与感恩之心不允许他将这些福祉据为己有。于是，尽管前路未卜，他毅然决定返回祖国，并着手实现他要做的事情。

他在毕业不久后启程前往香港，经历了一百五十一天的航行，于1855年四月抵达。当一名中国引航员登船时，他发现自己勉强还能听懂对方的话，但却无法让对方明白自己在说什么——这说明他当时对中文的掌握已极为薄弱。为了重新掌握中文，他花了整整两年的业余时间进行学习。

人生的第一步

至于他那宏大的计划，他早已在心中设定了第一步——设法让一些有影响力的公众人物听到他的想法，而这本身就难如登天。为了这个目标——当然也是为了谋生——他争取并获得了当时美国驻华专员彼得·帕克（Hon. Peter Parker）先生的私人秘书职位，希望借此得到他所期望的接触机会。但经过一段时间的尝试后，他认定此路不通，遂在数月后辞职。

他随后尝试了另一种方式。彼时在香港，有一批英籍律师为该市的外国商行提供服务，形成一个由十几人组成的律师团体。荣公想到，若能成为该律师团体的一员，所获得的身份与人脉或许可以帮助他实现目标。于是他进入其中一间律所，开始以学徒身份学习。但不久，这位青年人的身份和教育背景在律师圈中传开。律师们意识到，在一个中国城市中让这样一位才俊与他们竞争法律业务，是万万不可接受的。于是他的导师在“同行们的要求”之下，带着各种礼貌的措辞告诉他：必须另寻他处学习法律。可惜在当时，他别无选择，只能放弃。

此后近两年的时间里，他一边继续学习中文及其他知识，一边靠零星的商务翻译维持生计，耐心等待机会的降临。后来，他出于同样的期望，进入上海海关谋职，但这份工作经他一番评估后也被认为无法为他提供实现计划的立足点，于是他不久便放弃了。

此时已是1860年——五年过去，毫无成果。若只是从表面上看，容闳似乎一直在走一条动荡且收益甚微的道路；但若深入了解他真正的谋略与内心所怀的理想，则绝非如此。事实上，在这段他四处尝试、长期清贫的岁月中，他不断拒绝那些报酬丰厚的工作机会——在一个长期过着拮据生活的人眼中，这些待遇几乎称得上“王侯之禄”。然而在1860年，他终于接到上海一家大型丝茶行的聘请，邀请他担任内地巡回代表。部分因为这份工作能让他深入中国各地、通过亲身观察获取有价值的知识，他决定接受这项任务。他从事此项业务达一年之久，随后抓住一个机遇，开设了属于自己的生意，并迅速取得了巨大成功。若他继续从商，依当时的发展态势来看，他很快就能跻身富豪之列。即便他最后没有继续从商，他依然积攒了一笔可观的财富。

但到了1862年，那扇他自抵达中国那天起便不停寻觅的机会之门，终于意外地向他敞开。

事情是这样的：他在上海遇到了一位中国天文学家——这是一位具有地位与学问的名士。准确地说，是那位天文学家得知了容闳的来历，主动找上门来，想与他讨论天文学。在多次会面中，两人建立起了友谊。容闳在大学时学过比一般毕业生更扎实的天文知识，他把所知倾囊相授，对方受益匪浅。这位天文学家正是曾国藩麾下的一位官员。曾国藩时任江苏、江南总督，统帅清军，是当时清廷最有声望、最具影响力的重臣之一。天文学家将容闳的情况介绍给曾国藩后，不久，容闳便收到一封来自曾国藩的邀请信，希望与他会面，并暗示欲延揽他入幕。尽管容闳回信表示乐意，但由于某些不便说明的原因，他迟迟未赴约。这一局势微妙复杂，必须极其谨慎应对。

最终，他前往拜访曾国藩。当时正值太平天国战火最烈之时，曾国藩坐镇军营——这场会面就在长江边的安庆军营中进行。容闳意识到这次会面意义重大，见到曾国藩时甚至难掩紧张。曾国藩先是以锐利的目光长时间注视他，如容闳所说，他从未被如此审视过。之后，曾国藩请他坐下，要他讲述自己的生平经历。听完后，又问他对中国的看法、国家的需求、未来的走向以及对外交政策的见解。二人展开了长时间的谈话，曾国藩在其中透露了自己的种种主张，而容闳则听得大为震惊。他从未想过中国竟有这样的人物——一位并非年轻、却在中国本土成长的高官，头脑中竟然充满睿智光明，能洞察中国在融入国际体系中面临的诸多弊病，并拥有开明进步的思想。

被授予官职

这次会面的结果是，容闳受聘于曾国藩，并被授予五品官衔（清朝文武官分九品）。当时太平天国之乱正炽，曾国藩正在前线指挥作战。曾国藩首先提议任命他为军事指挥官，但容闳自知无此才能，婉拒了这项任命。不久后，在他自己的建议下，于1864年被派往海外采购军械制造设备，并获准动用巨额经费。他为此前往法国、英国及美国，最终选择在美国下单。1865年他带着设备返抵中国，任务完成得极为出色，曾国藩对他十分满意，晋升其为四品官。他采购的这些设备，成为江南制造局的基础。颇为讽刺的是，这位一心以基督教精神推动国家文明进步的人，最初竟是以建造兵工厂起步。但这并不矛盾，因为容闳的理念本质上极具爱国主义精神。

1865年至1870年，他先后被不同上级调遣至各地，从事多项任务。其中翻译工作占有重要地位。他将《帕森合同法》和另一本英国法律书籍译为中文；他还翻译了《科尔顿地理学》的大量章节，因为他认为地理知识对中国人极具裨益。

然而，始终萦绕于他心头、他魂牵梦萦的，仍是如何实现他多年来一直怀抱的教育计划。如今他终于有充分机会宣讲与倡导此事，他便锲而不舍、反复陈述。他主要的论点是：中国在国际关系、对外贸易及与外国交往中屡屡处于劣势，原因之一便是缺乏经过教育训练、能够代表国家利益的本国人才。许多重要职位不得不委托外国人担任，这些人可能忽视、甚至背叛中国利益。从军港、军舰、军队到海关，大量事务都掌握在外国人手中。他质问：安森·伯灵谦，一位美国人，怎么可以作为中国的全权使节，代表中国与他自己的国家及西方列强订立条约？——这便是他的一贯主张。




The most to whom he brought the matter 
heard him with indifference, but there were three 
men upon whom he made an impression all men 
of high rank and commanding influence. They 
were the Viceroy, Tsang Koh Fan, already 
named; Li Hung Chang, now Viceroy of the 
capital province of Chihli and the foremost 
Chinese statesman; and Ting Yi Tcheang, then 
Governor of the Province of Kiang Su, Yet 
these men, convinced as they were by Wing's 
reasons and avowedly favorable to his project, 
with all their eminence of position and their 
influence, were not ready to venture the attempt 
to carry it through with the Imperial Govern- 
ment. All the forces of conservatism would be 
opposed to it; the time for it had not come, 

In 1867, however, the Governor Ting, who 
was the most willing of the three, had made 
representations to an Imperial Minister named 
Wan Cheang, on the strength of which he was 
advised to address a memorial on the subject to 
the Imperial Council at Peking, Van Cheang 
undertaking to commend it to the attention of 
the Council. The situation was at this juncture 
moderately hopeful, but before the memorial 
reached the Council, the mother of Wan Cheang 
died, by which event he was, under the law of 
Chinese high official etiquette, retired from pub- 
lic life three entire years, and the whole business 
was set back to where it had been. These were 
years of great trial to Yung Wing. He was 
prospering, indeed, in one point of view, but the 
hope to which he was devoted was so long de- 
ferred that his heart was often sick. Understand 
that he was leading there in China an essentially 
solitary life. He had, soon after Ms return in 
1855, in accordance with his views of what was 
due to his purpose, resumed his native dress and 
identified himself not only thus externally, but 
also in large measure in every other respect with 
his own people. Especially from the time he 
became a Chinese Government official, he had 
dwelt in Chinese society, and had disappeared 
almost wholly from other society. He had his 
books and kept up diligently with what was 
going on in the world of learning and letters 
outside it was his only resource but he was 
exceedingly alone and lonely notwithstanding. 
The discouragements to his endeavor that faced 
him were so numerous and so solid that he was 
sometimes half disposed to give it all up; but 
only half disposed. 

One of the things that held him to it was not 
of a nature of an encouragement exactly, but it 
did excellently well as an antidote to the effect 
upon his spirits of his discouragements. It be- 
gan to come to Ms ears now and than that his 
American and English friends in CMna were 
whispering it among themselves that he was a 
failure, that he had had a noble chance and had 
not known how to improve it; that he was impracticable; 
and that this scheme of his was 
utterly visionary and could never be successful. 
Whenever Wing heard of this, he set his teeth 
and took a new hold. But altogether his faith 
and manhood were put to an extreme test. 

The end came though, as it always does in 
such cases, and came in a manner almost dra- 
matic. In the month of June, 1870, occurred 
the woeful tragedy at Tientsin called the Tien- 
tsin Massacre, in which a considerable number of 
French Roman Catholic missionaries, male and 
female, were murdered by a Chinese mob. It 
followed that a commission appointed by the 
foreign powers, diplomatically represented in 
China, met that same year at Tientsin to investi- 
gate the outrage and determine the satisfaction 
that was to be required for it, together with a 
like commission appointed by the Chinese Government 
authorized to bring the affair to a settlement. 
The Chinese Commission consisted of 
five, and three of these five were the three men 
of whom mention has been made, the viceroys 
Tsang Koh Fan and Li Hung Chang, and the 
Governor Ting Yi Tcheang. 

AN OPPORTUNITY SEIZED 

Yung Wing was at this time under official 
control of the last named, who, on being sum- 
moned to Tientsin, sent him word, for he was 
at a distance from him, to join the Commission 
at Tientsin as soon as possible, for his services 
would be needed there. Wing, though hasten- 
ing, arrived late on the scene and found the 
business concluded. But on receiving an account 
of the difficulties that had attended its transac- 
tion, and observing that the commissioners were 
conscious of their disadvantage in it, he perceived 
an auspicious occasion for making a stroke in 
behalf of his scheme, and he made the most of it. 
He restated his arguments, enforcing them by 
the illustration of the case at hand, and insisted 
with the utmost earnestness that there ought to 
be no delay. And this time he prevailed. The 
three friends of his idea being together and coun- 
tenancing one another, then and there agreed 
that they would at once take action to have the 
thing he proposed done, and would cast their 
united influence with the Government in its 
favor. They kept their agreement. They set 
their names to a memorial recommending the 
education of a corps of young men abroad for 
the Government service and at the Government 
expense. This memorial they forwarded to Pe- 
kin, where they backed it by all means in their 
power and to the effect that in the month of 
August, 1871, the measure recommended was 
adopted by the Imperial Government and a sum 
equal to $1,500,000 appropriated for its execution. 

Mandarin Yung Wing was scarcely able to 
support the joy of his triumph. For two days, 
as he has told the writer, he could neither eat 
nor sleep. He walked on air, and he worshipped 
God. It was sixteen years after his return to 
China and twenty years after he set out for this 
goal that heaven had at last granted his prayer. 
To him the organization of the enterprise was 
principally committed. The feature of the long 
term of fifteen years resolved upon for the course 
of study and training to be pursued, is particu- 
larly due to him and reflects the size of the man, 
the type of his mind and character. 

A school of candidates was at once opened at 
Shanghai from which the pupils were to be se- 
lected by competitive examination, and, as has 
been already stated, the first detachment of thirty 
arrived in the United States in 1872. The location 
of the Mission was also for him to determine. 
He might have procured its establishment 
in England, or France, or Germany; but as he 
himself had expressed it, the light that had en- 
lightened him shone from America and from 
New England, and to America and New Eng- 
land he was resolved from the first this Mission 
should repair. 

He was appointed Chief Commissioner of the 
Mission, receiving with the appointment his 
second promotion in rank, viz, to the Third or 
Blue Button grade. With him was associated, 
as co-commissioner, a venerable scholar and 
dignitary, Chin Lan Pin by name, who, how- 
ever, remained in this country less than two 
years, yielding his place to a younger man, Ngau 
Ngoh Liang, well-born, distinguished for learning, 
and a most agreeable gentleman. 

The students of the Mission have thus far, with 
very few exceptions, exhibited excellent ability 
as scholars, and in many instances extraordinary 
ability, and with fewer exceptions still have been 
marked by their exemplary conduct. They have 
everywhere been most hospitably received. They 
are certainly worthy to be objects of the highest 
and most friendly interest to every Christian 
citizen of the United States. 

Yung Wing was appointed, December 11, 
1876, Associate Minister with his former colleague 
in the Educational Mission, Chin Lan 
Pin, to the United States, Peru and Spain. On 
this occasion he was again promoted in rank, 
that is, to Second or Red Button grade, and 
invested with the title of Tao-tai (or Intend- 
ant) of the Province of Kiang Su. 

He expects, on the now approaching arrival 
of Chin Lan Pin in the country, to take up his 
residence in Washington, yet not to relinquish 
the general superintendence of the institution 
which is so dear to him and has cost him so much, 
and in which are hound up his best patriotic hopes 
for his native land, for he is a patriot from head 
to foot, in every fiber of his body. He loves the 
Chinese nation and believes in it, doubting not 
that there is before it a grand career worthy of 
its noble soil and of its august antiquity. 

If it were the aim of the writer to magnify 
Yung Wing, which it is not, but only to tell 
the story of the Chinese Educational Mission 
to the United States, there are many things 
more that might be related of him, all going to 
show Mm to be of the stuff that heroes are made 
of, and one of the most significant characters in 
modern civilization. But because to relate them 
would be aside from the purpose in hand, and 
also because it would grievously offend Yung 
Wing to have them published, they are passed 
by. It must be said, for the last word, that even 
in attributing to him so much credit of the Edu- 
cational Mission itself, the share he allows him- 
self is very far exceeded. He is accustomed to 
assign the chief honor of it to those three men 
of China who helped it so potently with their 
influence, Tsang Koh Fan died in 1871- His 
portrait hangs on the wall of the Mission House 
in Hartford; and the portraits of the other two 
are there also. The boys are taught to reverence 
these men as their benefactors. And they are 
worthy of reverence. Their names deserve to 
be remembered, and will be, and not alone in 
China. Yet undoubtedly had there been no 
Yung Wing, that illustrious good deed of theirs 
had never been performed.


他向许多人陈述他的想法，大多数人都漠不关心地听着。但有三个人，他成功地打动了——三人皆位高权重、极具影响力。他们是早前提到的曾国藩总督，时任直隶总督、后来成为中国首席重臣的李鸿章，以及当时的江苏巡抚丁日昌。

尽管这些人都被容闳的理由所说服，并公开表示支持他的计划，但即使他们地位显赫、权势通天，仍不愿贸然冒险去推动该计划在朝廷中获得批准。所有保守势力都将对其进行反对，时机尚未成熟。

然而在1867年，三人中最愿意行动的丁巡抚向一位名叫万承的朝廷大臣陈述了此事。在万承的建议下，他被鼓励向北京的军机处呈递奏折，提议设立留学计划。万承承诺将向军机处推荐此事。当时的形势可以说略显乐观，但不巧的是，奏折尚未送达军机处，万承的母亲去世。按中国高级官员的礼制规定，他必须守孝三年，完全退出政务。于是整件事又被搁置了，回到了原点。

这段时期对容闳而言是极为煎熬的。他的事业在某种程度上算是顺利，但他所寄托的希望迟迟未能实现，让他心灰意冷。你要知道，他在中国过着极为孤独的生活。1855年回国后不久，为了配合自己的理想，他恢复了中国装束，不仅在外表上，而且在很大程度上在生活方式和思想上重新认同了自己的民族。尤其是自他成为朝廷官员以来，便长期生活在中国人的社交圈中，几乎与其他圈子断绝了来往。他以书为伴，勤于阅读，了解世界学术与文化的动态，这是他唯一的精神寄托。但即便如此，他依然感到无比孤寂。

他面前的重重阻碍和艰难险阻曾一度让他几乎打算放弃，但也只是“几乎”而已。

支撑他坚持下来的，并不完全是鼓舞性的力量，而是一种对抗失望的良药。他开始听到一些传言，说他在中国的美国和英国朋友私下议论，认为他失败了，错失了大好机会；说他不切实际，所提的计划不过是空想，绝无实现可能。每当容闳听到这些，他便咬紧牙关，再次振作精神。然而，他的信心与意志确实承受了极大的考验。

结局终于来了，就如所有这种情况中最终总会出现的那样，而且来得颇具戏剧性。

1870年6月，天津发生了骇人听闻的“天津教案”，数名法国天主教传教士（包括男修士和女修士）被暴民杀害。随后，由当时驻华各国外交代表组成的调查委员会前往天津，就事件进行调查并要求赔偿。同时，清政府也组成了一个五人委员会，与其协商解决事宜。清方五人中，有三人正是前文提到的曾国藩、李鸿章与丁日昌。

抓住机会

当时，容闳在丁日昌的管辖之下。丁日昌接到赴津命令后，立即派人通知远在外地的容闳，命他尽快前往天津参与事务处理，因为需要他在场协助。

容闳虽迅速赶往，仍迟到一步，事务已基本处理完毕。但他了解了过程中存在的重重困难，又看到清方代表在谈判中处于不利地位，敏锐地察觉到这是推动他计划的大好时机，便不失时机地大力陈述自己的理由，以眼前案例为例，加以强调。他极其恳切地主张应立即付诸实施。

这一次，他终于成功了。他的三位支持者难得地同时在场，彼此声援，三人当场一致同意采取实际行动，推动他的提案，并联手向朝廷施加影响。他们信守承诺，联名上奏，建议选派青年赴国外学习，为国家效力，费用由政府负担。

他们将奏折送往北京，并尽一切努力加以推动。最终，在1871年8月，该项建议被清廷采纳，拨款一百五十万美元（折合银两）以作执行经费。

容闳几乎无法承受这突如其来的喜悦。他曾对笔者说，这两天他几乎无法饮食与入眠。他如行云中，并虔诚向上帝致敬。这是他回国十六年、立志二十年后，终于盼来的实现。他被主要委任负责整个项目的组织工作。

留学生的长期培养计划——十五年学程——尤其出自他的构想，反映出他格局之大，思想与人格之深。

他们立即在上海开办预备学校，学生通过竞争考试选拔，正如前文所述，第一批三十名学生于1872年来到美国。

任务地点的选择权也在他。他本可将留学地设在英国、法国或德国，但正如他自己所说，启迪他的光源自美洲、源自新英格兰，因此他自始即决心将这项事业带往美国与新英格兰。

他被任命为留美教育使团的总监督（Chief Commissioner），并因此获得晋升，授予“三品蓝翎顶戴”（即三品蓝顶）。与他共同担任使团事务的，是一位德高望重的学者与朝廷大员，名叫陈兰彬。但陈只在美国停留不到两年，便由一位年轻官员牛鉴接替其职。牛鉴出身显赫，学识渊博，为人极为可亲。

这些学生大多展现出优异乃至卓越的学业能力，且行为举止也堪称楷模。他们在美国各地受到热烈接待，毫无疑问，值得每一位美国基督徒公民给予最高的关心与友谊。

1876年12月11日，容闳被任命为中国驻美国、秘鲁与西班牙的“出使大臣衔随员”，与原使团同僚陈兰彬共同任职。他再次获晋升为“二品红顶”，并授予江苏道台（即江苏省分巡道）之衔。

他期望在陈兰彬即将返美之时，自己将常驻华盛顿，虽身居异地，仍不打算放弃对该教育机构的总体督导，因为那是他倾注心血的事业，凝聚了他对祖国最深沉的爱国希望。他是一个彻底的爱国者，满怀热情地热爱中华民族，并深信这个民族必将迎来一个辉煌的未来——一个与其伟大国土与悠久文明相称的未来。

如果笔者的目的是歌颂容闳（其实并非如此），而只是想讲述“留美幼童教育计划”的历史，那么关于容闳还有许多事迹可述——足以显示他具有英雄之气，堪称现代文明中最具意义的人物之一。但因为这既偏离本文主旨，也可能令容闳大为不悦，所以此处略去不谈。

最后必须指出的是，即便我们将这项教育计划的巨大成功归功于容闳本人，他自己所承认的贡献也远远小于他实际的贡献。他始终把主要功劳归于那三位鼎力相助的中国重臣——曾国藩于1871年去世，他的画像现悬挂于哈特福德留学事务所中，另外两位的画像也在。他们的学生被教导要尊敬这些恩人，而这三人确实值得敬仰。他们的名字将被铭记，并非只在中国。然而不可否认的是，若无容闳，这三位重臣的善举恐怕也无从实现。
