APPENDIX 

An address by the Rev. Joseph H. Twichell, delivered 
before the Kent Club of the Yale Law School, April 10, 
1878. 

A visitor to the City of Hartford, at the pres- 
ent time, will be likely to meet on the streets 
groups of Chinese boys, in their native dress, 
though somewhat modified, and speaking their 
native tongue, yet seeming, withal, to be very 
much at home. He will also occasionally meet 
Chinese men who, by their bearing, will impress 
him as being gentlemen of their race. 

These gentlemen are officers, and these boys 
are pupils of the Chinese Educational Mission, 
although one of the most remarkable and signifi- 
cant institutions of the age on the face of the 
whole earth. The object of the mission, now of 
nearly six years' standing, is the education in 
this country, through a term of fifteen years, of 
a corps of young men for the Chinese Govern- 
ment service; that Government paying the whole 
cost an annual expense of about $100,000. The 
number of the officers is five, viz, the two Im- 
perial Commissioners in charge, a translator and 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

interpreter and two teachers. The function of 
the teachers is to direct the Chinese education of 
the pupils, which proceeds pan passu with their 
Western education. The number of pupils was 
originally 120, but now 112, one having died 
and seven having, for various reasons, returned 
to China. A fine, large house recently erected 
by the Chinese Government in the western part 
of the City, at a cost of fifty thousand dollars, 
is the headquarters of the Mission. There are 
the offices of the officers, and there is lodged the 
class that is present for examination and instruc- 
tion in Chinese studies. For this purpose the 
pupils are divided into classes of about twenty, 
one coming as another goes, each staying at the 
Mission House two weeks at a time. A small 
part only of the whole number are permanently 
located in Hartford. Most of them are in other 
places, though not far away, generally two to- 
gether -attending school or receiving private in- 
struction in families. 

They come in yearly companies of thirty, be- 
ginning with 1872, and the last detachment is 
still chiefly engaged in learning our language. 

The plan is to afford these boys the advantages 
of our best educational institutions academies, 
colleges, and, to some extent, professional schools 



APPENDIX 249 

to assign them, by and by, as they shall develop 
aptitude, to various special courses of study and 
training in the physical, mechanical and military 
sciences, in political history and economy, inter- 
national law, the principles and practice of civil 
administration and in all departments and 
branches of knowledge, skill in which is useful 
for public government service in these modern 
times. And through the whole process of this 
education, it is to be impressed upon them that 
they belong and are to belong to their nation, 
for whose sake they are elected to enjoy these 
great and peculiar opportunities. The result 
will be, if all goes well and the plan is carried 
out, and there is apparently nothing now to 
prevent it, that in the year 1887 or thereabout 
there will go from this country to China a body 
of somewhere near a hundred men who have 
grown up under exceedingly favorable condi- 
tions from early youth to manhood here among 
us, destined to hold places of importance in the 
government and in the society of their native 
land, better equipped in all save experience to 
do for that land what most needs to be done, 
and inspired for their work with a more enlight- 
ened sense of patriotic duty and responsibility 
than any other hundred of her sons of their 



250 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

generation. And who can forecast or estimate 
the consequences that Divine Providence is thus 



preparing? 



COMMISSIONER YUNG WING 

Such in brief outline is the Chinese Educa- 
tional Mission to the United States. The head 
and front of the whole marvellous enterprise, 
humanly speaking, is Commissioner Yung Wing. 
While others whose cooperation was indispensa- 
ble, have, as will presently appear, contributed 
to it and still stand back of it, and justly share 
the credit of it with him, to him more than to 
any other man beside, probably more than to 
all other men beside, its existence is due. Its 
history, thus far, cannot be better told except in 
that connection, so intimately -are the two his- 
tories related. But it becomes one who speaks 
of Yung Wing to observe the principle that we 
must be modest for a modest man, for so modest 
a man as he is is rare to find. He was born in 
1828, of a worthy family in humble life, near the 
city of Macao in Southern China. In the year 
1839 he became a pupil in a children's school, 
opened by Mrs. Gutzlaff, the wife of an English 
missionary, his parents consenting to it in the 



APPENDIX 251 

Idea that it would be a profitable thing for him to 
learn the English language. Proving a bright 
scholar, he was in time promoted to the Morrison 
School, an institution founded by English mer- 
chants in Macao and named after Robert Morri- 
son, the first English Protestant, but at this 
time under charge of the Rev. S. R. Brown, a 
teacher engaged by the Morrison Educational 
Society. When later this school was transferred 
to Hong Kong he went with it, and remained 
in it till he came to this country. He suffered, 
however, during this time serious interruption by 
the death of his father, which required him to 
go home and, a boy that he was, assist in the 
support of his family. This he did by wages 
earned in the printing establishment of a Portu- 
guese Roman Catholic mission in Macao. 

In 1847, Mr. Brown, who had long noted his 
patient ardor in study, the marks of ability he 
showed and a certain original vigor of will and 
strength of character that were in him, brought 
him, at the age of sixteen, with two other native 
lads, also his pupils, of about the same age, to 
the United States; Andrew Shortrede, a large- 
hearted Scotchman, founder, proprietor and edi- 
tor of The China Mail, published at Hong 
Kong, engaging to advance the means of their 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

support for two years. The three boys were 
entered together at the academy in Monson, 
Mass., and were received into the family of Mr. 
Brown's mother, who lived at Monson, a royal 
woman whose name is memorable in the church 
of Christ as that of the author of the hymn, "I 
love to steal awhile away/' It was while a mem- 
ber of her godly household that Yung Wing 
became a Christian believer. 

It will not be out of place to state here, as a 
fact, the significance of which will be readily 
appreciated, that he caused the son who was born 
to him in 1876 his first-born to be named in 
baptism Morrison Brown, an eloquent act of 
recognition and profession. Of Wing's two com- 
panions one, Wong Shing, was compelled, by 
want of health, to return to China the next year. 
There, in the office of The China Mail,, he 
learned the art of printing. From 1852 or 1853 
he was for several years connected with the press 
of the London Mission under Dr. Legge, now 
the eminent Professor of the Chinese Language 
and Literature in Oxford University. In 1873 
he accompanied the second detachment of 
Chinese students to this country, and is at pres- 
ent under appointment as interpreter to the 
Chinese Legation soon to be established at Wash- 
ington. 



APPENDIX 53 

The other, Wong Fun, went to Scotland in 
1850, and after two years general study entered 
the Medical Department of Edinburgh Univer- 
sity, at which he graduated with very high honor. 
Returning to China in 1856, he hegan the prac- 
tice of medicine in the city of Canton and is most 
highly esteemed on all that coast, both for his 
private character and for his professional talents, 
being held by many foreign residents the ablest 
physician in the whole region of the East beyond 
Calcutta. Wong Fun died Oct. 15th, 1878. 

IN YALE COLLEGE 

Yung Wing, after two years and a half spent 
iat Monson, Mass., was, in 1850, though but 
poorly fitted for want of time, admitted to the 
Freshman Class in Yale College. His career in 
college was, in some respects, a remarkable one. 
Owing to his inadequate preparations, he did not, 
though he worked hard, take a high stand in 
general scholarship, yet he excelled in the de- 
partments of writing and metaphysics, and 
made a sensation that was felt beyond the col- 
lege walls by bearing off repeated prizes for 
English composition. Throughout his entire 
course he contended with poverty, a circumstance 



254 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the explanation of which deserves notice. When 
he became a Christian, at Monson, he heard and 
at once accepted his Divine call to devote his 
life to the Christian service of his nation. But 
the form of that service what should it he? 
This question he had to answer, at least in part. 
The presumption was, and it was assumed by 
Ms friends and by the public so far as his case 
was known, that he would be a minister of the 
Gospel. But right then and there, after much 
careful and prayerful thinking, this boy of 
seventeen, though by no means doubting the 
value of Christian missions, fully recognizing 
the fact, indeed, that he himself was the direct 
fruit of Christian missions, which, be it ever 
remembered, he was, concluded, with an inde- 
pendence characteristic of him even at that age, 
that it was not best for him to be a missionary. 
He had a suspicion then, though indistinct, that 
he was wanted for something else. It was a 
costly conclusion and he was quite aware of it. 
It was against the views and hopes of the most 
of those who were around him, and by it, being 
without pecuniary means, he cut himself off from 
the resource of those charitable foundations that 
would have aided him as a student for the minis- 
try. And so he was poor in college; he smiles 



APPENDIX 255 

now to remember how poor. Yet he received 
help from persons interested in him; at New 
Haven and elsewhere, mainly through the 
medium of Professor Thatcher,, whose care for 
him in that matter claims his liveliest gratitude 
to this day. And he got through. He came to 
college in his cue and Chinese tunic, hut put off 
both in the course of his first year* 

His nationality made him a good deal of a 
stranger, and this, together with his extreme 
natural reserve and his poverty, kept him from 
mingling much with the social life of college. 
He had not many intimates, yet he so carried 
himself from first to last as to merit and win the 
entire respect of all his class. It was in certain 
long walks and talks he had with his classmate, 
Carrol Cutler, now president of Western Re- 
serve College, that he opened and discussed the 
project then forming in his mind of this Chinese 
Educational Mission. The idea was born, the 
dream was taking shape, but the way was long 
to its realization. 

His graduation in 1854 was the event of the 
Commencement of that year. There were many, 
at least, who so regarded it, and some of them 
came to the Commencement principally for the 
sake of seeing the Chinese graduate. Among 



256 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the latter was Dr. Bushnell of Hartford. He 
had heard of him and being strongly interested, 
according to the size of his great mind and heart, 
in the Chinese race, he desired to meet Yung 
Wing. An incident of their meeting on that 
occasion, which the writer has heard Dr. Bush- 
nell tell, will bear repeating: When they were 
introduced, the Doctor gave it as one of his 
reasons for seeking the introduction that he de- 
sired to ascertain who had written certain news- 
paper articles on the Chinese question, as it then 
stood, which had attracted his attention as evinc- 
ing marks of statesmanship. He thought Wing 
might know. Whereupon, as the Doctor said, 
Wing hung his head, and blushing like a girl, 
with much confusion of manner, confessed that 
he was their author. It is only fair to add that 
Mr, Wing says that he does not remember this 
incident. But it is equally fair to add again 
that in a case of this kind Dr. BushnelTs memory, 
or anybody else's, were more worthy to be 
trusted than Yung Wing's. 

At the time of his graduation, Wing was as 
much tempted as it was possible for him to be, 
to change the plan of his life. He had been in 
this country long enough to becom'e thoroughly 
naturalized here. He was, in fact, a citizen. All 



APPENDIX 257 

his tastes and feelings and affinities, intellectual 
and moral, made him at home here. Moreover, 
through the notice into which his graduation 
brought him, it came about that a very inviting 
opportunity was opened to him to remain and 
have his career here if he chose to. On the other 
hand, China was like a strange land to him. He 
had even almost entirely forgotten his native 
tongue. And there was nothing in China for 
him to go to. Except among his humble kindred, 
he had no friends there; nothing to give him any 
standing or consideration, no place, so to speak, 
to set his foot on. Not only so, but considering 
where he had been and what he had become, and 
the purpose he had in view, he could not fail to 
encounter, among his own people, prejudice, 
suspicion, hostility. A cheerless, forbidding 
prospect lay before him in that direction. The 
thought of going back was the thought of exile. 
He wanted immensely to stay. But there was 
one text of Holy Scripture that, all this while, 
he says, haunted Mm and followed him like the 
voice of God. It was this: "If any provide not 
for his own, and specially for those of his own 
house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than 
an infidel." And by the words "his own" and 
"his own house," it meant to him the nation of 



258 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

which he was born. The text carried the day. 
The benefits which he had been, as it were, 
singled out from a whole people to receive, his 
sense of justice and gratitude alike would not 
let him appropriate to his own advantage. And 
so, though he knew not what should befall him, 
he set his face to return; and he went to do what 
he has done. 

He sailed soon after his graduation for Hong 
Kong which, after a voyage of 151 days, he 
reached in the month of April, 1855. When the 
Chinese pilot came on board he found that he 
could, with some difficulty, understand what he 
said, though he could not make the pilot under- 
stand him, which shows the condition of his 
knowledge of Chinese on his arrival in the 
country. It took him! all the time he was not 
otherwise employed for two years to acquire 
facility in the use of it. 

TAKING FIRST STEPS IN LIFE 

As for his grand scheme, he had settled it in 
his own mind that the first step to be taken 
toward carrying it out was to contrive a way 
of getting it before some influential public man 
or men a thing itself of infinite difficulty. 



APPENDIX 259 

With this end in view, though, of course, to make 
his living also, he sought and obtained the posi- 
tion of private secretary to the Hon. Peter Par- 
ker, then Commissioner of the United States to 
China, hoping that it would be the means of 
affording him the access he desired. Becoming 
satisfied upon a sufficient trial that it was not 
likely to answer his expectations in this regard, 
he resigned the place after a few months. He 
now attempted another way of compassing the 
matter. There was at Hong Kong an English 
bar consisting of a dozen or so lawyers doing 
business for the foreign commercial houses of 
that City. Wing bethought him that the stand- 
ing and acquaintance resulting from his becom- 
ing a member of that bar might not improbably 
bring him the opportunity he sought. Accord- 
ingly, he entered one of the offices as a student. 
But presently it got out among the lawyers who 
this young man was, what his education had 
been, and they saw that his competition with 
them for legal practice of a Chinese city was a 
thing not to be allowed if it could be prevented. 
And so his principal, pleading the commands 
of his legal brethren, informed him, with many 
courteous expressions of regret, that he must 
find another place to study law in. And as 



260 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

there was no other place, he had to give it up. 

After this followed an interval of nearly two 
years, during which he occupied himself with 
Chinese and other studies, earning his bread by 
such commercial translation as he could find to 
do, and waited for the right thing to turn up. 
He then, in the same hope that led him to his 
previous experiments, took a place in the Cus- 
toms Service at Shanghai. But neither did this, 
on trial, promise, in his judgment, a pou sto 
for his operations, and he soon abandoned it. 

It was now 1860. Five years and nothing 
accomplished! To one only looking on the out- 
side Yung Wing would appear to have thus 
far pursued an uncertain and rather thriftless 
course; but not if he penetrated his real policy 
and the purpose that lay ever nearest his heart; 
most assuredly not if he knew what was the 
fact that all this time that he was going from 
one thing to another and keeping himself poor, 
he was refusing offers of employment at rates 
of remuneration that to him, so long familiar 
with a straightened lot, seemed little short of 
princely. In 1860, however, overtures were 
made him by one of the leading silk and tea 
houses of Shanghai to enter its service as travel* 
ing inland agent, which, for the reason in part 



APPENDIX 261 

that it would send him touring through a wide 
extent of country and possess him, by observa- 
tion, of a knowledge that he deemed would be 
useful to him, he determined to accept. This 
business he followed for a year, and then, seeing 
a good chance for it, set up in a business for 
himself which proved so profitable a venture that, 
had he continued in it, he would, to all appear- 
ances, have speedily become rich. As it was, he 
made a very considerable sum of money* 

But in 1862 the door of the opportunity which 
he had been constantly feeling after from the 
day he landed in China, unexpectedly opened to 
him. 

It was in this wise: While in the city of 
Shanghai, he made the acquaintance of a Chinese 
astronomer a man of rank and of eminence in 
learning. Or rather, the astronomer, who had 
in some way gained intelligence of Wing's ante- 
cedents, sought his acquaintance for the sake of 
talking astronomy with him. In repeated inter- 
views through which their acquaintance pro- 
gressed to the degree of mutual friendly regard, 
Wing, who had carried away from college a 
better knowledge of astronomy than most gradu- 
ates do, told him all he knew, which was a long 
advance upon his own previous acquisitions in 



26 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

that science. This astronomer was an officer of 
the great Tsang Kwoh Fan, viceroy of Kiang Su 
and Kiang Nan provinces, generalissimo of the 
Imperial forces and one of the very most promi- 
nent and leading men in the whole Empire. 
Through representations made to him by the 
astronomer, he soon sent a message to Yung 
Wing desiring to see him, and hinting a desire to 
take him into his service. Though returning a 
favorable reply to the message, under all the 
circumstances and for reasons that cannot be 
explained, Wing delayed responding to it in 
person for a considerable time. The situation 
was a delicate one, requiring extreme caution 
and circumspection on his part. 

But at length he paid Tsang Koh Fan the 
promised visit. He felt the occasion to be a 
critical one, and when ushered into the great 
man's presence found it difficult to retain his 
composure. Tsang Koh Fan first bent upon 
him a long, intense, piercing gaze. As Wing 
says, he had never been looked at in his life as 
he was then. Then causing him to be seated, he 
required of him an account of his history, which 
he gave. He then questioned him as to his views 
respecting China, her needs, her outlook, her 
public policy, and so on. A long conversation 



APPENDIX 263 

followed in which the Viceroy disclosed his views, 
to which Wing listened with amazement. For, 
behold, here was a man such as he had not sup- 
posed existed in that country a man reared in 
China, and not a young man either who had 
light in his head; who recognized the causes of 
many of the disadvantages China was contending 
with in taking her place among the family of 
nations; a man of marvellously liberal and pro- 
gressive sentiments. 

MADE A MANDAHIN 

The result of the interview was that Wing 
entered his service and was made a Mandarin 
of the fifth rank, there being nine degrees of that 
dignity in the Chinese official system, At this 
time the great Taiping rebellion was at its height 
and Tsang Koh Fan was in the field. In fact, 
the interview had taken place at his camp in 
Ngankin, on the Yang Tse River, The Viceroy 
first tendered Wing a military command which, 
on the score of lack of qualification, he asked 
leave to decline. He was then, shortly after, 
1864, at his own suggestion, despatched abroad 
to purchase machinery for the manufacture of 
arms, for which purpose the expenditure of a 



264 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

large sum of money was intrusted to him. On 
this errand he visited France and England as 
well as the United States, but finally gave his 
orders here. On returning with his purchases 
to China in 1865, what he had done was so satis- 
factory to his chief that he was advanced to the 
next higher grade of official rank, viz, the 
Fourth. The machinery he had bought was the 
foundation of the Kiang Nan Arsenal. It is 
curious to remark that the first work of a man 
whose supreme ambition it was, from Christian 
motives, to set his country forward in civilization, 
should have been the establishment of an arsenaL 
But it quite consisted with Yung Wing's ideas, 
which were intensely patriotic. 

From 1865 to 1870 he was variously employed 
in different places, being under command now 
of one superior and now of another. Among 
the work that he did during this period, that of 
translation was prominent. He translated into 
Chinese Parson's Law of Contracts, and a book 
of English Law. He also translated large por- 
tions of Colton's Geography, deeming that 
geographical knowledge was as likely to prove 
beneficial to his countrymen as any. 

But the thing that lay nearest his heart and 
that was continually before him, was the question 



APPENDIX 65 

of how to accomplish the plan he had so many 
years held in hope. He now had ample oppor- 
tunity to expound and advocate it, and he did 
so with inexhaustible perseverance. The main 
argument he used was this : China, in her inter- 
national relations, in her commercial and other 
intercourse with foreign peoples, suffers disad- 
vantage and much detriment from want of men 
capable by education of acting as her representa- 
tives. She is forced to employ in many most 
important places, that ought to be occupied by 
her own citizens, foreigners by whom her inter- 
ests are liable to be neglected or betrayed. Her 
forts, her ships of war, her military forces, her 
customs, are largely in charge of foreigners. 
How was it proper, he asked, that Anson Bur- 
lingame, an American, should be her chief agent 
in arranging a treaty with his own country and 
other western governments? This was his gen- 
eral line of reasoning. 

The most to whom he brought the matter 
heard him with indifference, but there were three 
men upon whom he made an impression all men 
of high rank and commanding influence. They 
were the Viceroy, Tsang Koh Fan, already 
named; Li Hung Chang, now Viceroy of the 
capital province of Chihli and the foremost 



266 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Chinese statesman; and Ting Yi Tcheang, then 
Governor of the Province of Kiang Su, Yet 
these men, convinced as they were by Wing's 
reasons and avowedly favorable to his project, 
with all their eminence of position and their 
influence, were not ready to venture the attempt 
to carry it through with the Imperial Govern- 
ment. All the forces of conservatism would be 
opposed to it; the time for it had not come, 

In 1867, however, the Governor Ting, who 
was the most willing of the three, had made 
representations to an Imperial Minister named 
Wan Cheang, on the strength of which he was 
advised to address a memorial on the subject to 
the Imperial Council at Peking, Van Cheang 
undertaking to commend it to the attention of 
the Council. The situation was at this juncture 
moderately hopeful, but before the memorial 
reached the Council, the mother of Wan Cheang 
died, by which event he was, under the law of 
Chinese high official etiquette, retired from pub- 
lic life three entire years, and the whole business 
was set back to where it had been. These were 
years of great trial to Yung Wing. He was 
prospering, indeed, in one point of view, but the 
hope to which he was devoted was so long de- 
ferred that his heart was often sick. Understand 



APPENDIX 267 

that he was leading there in China an essentially 
solitary life. He had, soon after Ms return in 
1855, in accordance with his views of what was 
due to his purpose, resumed his native dress and 
identified himself not only thus externally, but 
also in large measure in every other respect with 
his own people. Especially from the time he 
became a Chinese Government official, he had 
dwelt in Chinese society, and had disappeared 
almost wholly from other society. He had his 
books and kept up diligently with what was 
going on in the world of learning and letters 
outside it was his only resource but he was 
exceedingly alone and lonely notwithstanding. 
The discouragements to his endeavor that faced 
him were so numerous and so solid that he was 
sometimes half disposed to give it all up; but 
only half disposed. 

One of the things that held him to it was not 
of a nature of an encouragement exactly, but it 
did excellently well as an antidote to the effect 
upon his spirits of his discouragements. It be- 
gan to come to Ms ears now and than that his 
American and English friends in CMna were 
whispering it among themselves that he was a 
failure, that he had had a noble chance and had 
not known how to improve it; that he was im- 



268 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

practicable; and that this scheme of his was 
utterly visionary and could never be successful. 
Whenever Wing heard of this, he set his teeth 
and took a new hold. But altogether his faith 
and manhood were put to an extreme test. 

The end came though, as it always does in 
such cases, and came in a manner almost dra- 
matic. In the month of June, 1870, occurred 
the woeful tragedy at Tientsin called the Tien- 
tsin Massacre, in which a considerable number of 
French Roman Catholic missionaries, male and 
female, were murdered by a Chinese mob. It 
followed that a commission appointed by the 
foreign powers, diplomatically represented in 
China, met that same year at Tientsin to investi- 
gate the outrage and determine the satisfaction 
that was to be required for it, together with a 
like commission appointed by the Chinese Gov- 
ernment authorized to bring the affair to a settle- 
ment. The Chinese Commission consisted of 
five, and three of these five were the three men 
of whom mention has been made, the viceroys 
Tsang Koh Fan and Li Hung Chang, and the 
Governor Ting Yi Tcheang. 



APPENDIX 269 

AN OPPORTUNITY SEIZED 

Yung Wing was at this time under official 
control of the last named, who, on being sum- 
moned to Tientsin, sent him word, for he was 
at a distance from him, to join the Commission 
at Tientsin as soon as possible, for his services 
would be needed there. Wing, though hasten- 
ing, arrived late on the scene and found the 
business concluded. But on receiving an account 
of the difficulties that had attended its transac- 
tion, and observing that the commissioners were 
conscious of their disadvantage in it, he perceived 
an auspicious occasion for making a stroke in 
behalf of his scheme, and he made the most of it. 
He restated his arguments, enforcing them by 
the illustration of the case at hand, and insisted 
with the utmost earnestness that there ought to 
be no delay. And this time he prevailed. The 
three friends of his idea being together and coun- 
tenancing one another, then and there agreed 
that they would at once take action to have the 
thing he proposed done, and would cast their 
united influence with the Government in its 
favor. They kept their agreement. They set 
their names to a memorial recommending the 
education of a corps of young men abroad for 



270 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the Government service and at the Government 
expense. This memorial they forwarded to Pe- 
kin, where they backed it by all means in their 
power and to the effect that in the month of 
August, 1871, the measure recommended was 
adopted by the Imperial Government and a sum 
equal to $1,500,000 appropriated for its execu- 
tion. 

Mandarin Yung Wing was scarcely able to 
support the joy of his triumph. For two days, 
as he has told the writer, he could neither eat 
nor sleep. He walked on air, and he worshipped 
God. It was sixteen years after his return to 
China and twenty years after he set out for this 
goal that heaven had at last granted his prayer. 
To him the organization of the enterprise was 
principally committed. The feature of the long 
term of fifteen years resolved upon for the course 
of study and training to be pursued, is particu- 
larly due to him and reflects the size of the man, 
the type of his mind and character. 

A school of candidates was at once opened at 
Shanghai from which the pupils were to be se- 
lected by competitive examination, and, as has 
been already stated, the first detachment of thirty 
arrived in the United States in 1872. The lo- 
cation of the Mission was also for him to deter-

mine. He might have procured its establishment 
in England, or France, or Germany; but as he 
himself had expressed it, the light that had en- 
lightened him shone from America and from 
New England, and to America and New Eng- 
land he was resolved from the first this Mission 
should repair. 

He was appointed Chief Commissioner of the 
Mission, receiving with the appointment his 
second promotion in rank, viz, to the Third or 
Blue Button grade. With him was associated, 
as co-commissioner, a venerable scholar and 
dignitary, Chin Lan Pin by name, who, how- 
ever, remained in this country less than two 
years, yielding his place to a younger man, Ngau 
Ngoh Liang, well-born, distinguished for learn- 
ing, and a most agreeable gentleman. 

The students of the Mission have thus far, with 
very few exceptions, exhibited excellent ability 
as scholars, and in many instances extraordinary 
ability, and with fewer exceptions still have been 
marked by their exemplary conduct. They have 
everywhere been most hospitably received. They 
are certainly worthy to be objects of the highest 
and most friendly interest to every Christian 
citizen of the United States. 

Yung Wing was appointed, December 11, 



#72 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

1876, Associate Minister with his former col- 
league in the Educational Mission, Chin Lan 
Pin, to the United States, Peru and Spain. On 
this occasion he was again promoted in rank, 
that is, to Second or Red Button grade, and 
invested with the title of Tao-tai (or Intend- 
ant) of the Province of Kiang Su. 

He expects, on the now approaching arrival 
of Chin Lan Pin in the country, to take up his 
residence in Washington, yet not to relinquish 
the general superintendence of the institution 
which is so dear to him and has cost him so much, 
and in which are hound up his best patriotic hopes 
for his native land, for he is a patriot from head 
to foot, in every fiber of his body. He loves the 
Chinese nation and believes in it, doubting not 
that there is before it a grand career worthy of 
its noble soil and of its august antiquity. 

If it were the aim of the writer to magnify 
Yung Wing, which it is not, but only to tell 
the story of the Chinese Educational Mission 
to the United States, there are many things 
more that might be related of him, all going to 
show Mm to be of the stuff that heroes are made 
of, and one of the most significant characters in 
modern civilization. But because to relate them 
would be aside from the purpose in hand, and

also because it would grievously offend Yung 
Wing to have them published, they are passed 
by. It must be said, for the last word, that even 
in attributing to him so much credit of the Edu- 
cational Mission itself, the share he allows him- 
self is very far exceeded. He is accustomed to 
assign the chief honor of it to those three men 
of China who helped it so potently with their 
influence, Tsang Koh Fan died in 1871- His 
portrait hangs on the wall of the Mission House 
in Hartford; and the portraits of the other two 
are there also. The boys are taught to reverence 
these men as their benefactors. And they are 
worthy of reverence. Their names deserve to 
be remembered, and will be, and not alone in 
China. Yet undoubtedly had there been no 
Yung Wing, that illustrious good deed of theirs 
had never been performed,
