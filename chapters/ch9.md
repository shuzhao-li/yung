CHAPTER IX 

MY FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA 
DISTRICTS 

On the llth of March, 1859, I found myself 
on board of a Woo-Sik-Kwei, a Chinese boat 
built in Woo-Sik, a city situated on the borders 
of the Grand Canal, within a short distance of 
the famous city of Suchau a rival of the city of 
Hangchau, for wealth, population, silk manu- 
facture, and luxury. The word "Kwei" means 
"fast." Therefore, Woo-Sik-Kwei means fast 
boats of Woo-Sik. These passenger boats which 
plied between the principal cities and marts 
situated near the waters of the canal and lake 
system in southern Kianksu, were usually built 
of various sizes and nicely fitted up for the com- 
fort and convenience of the public. Those 
intended for officials, and the wealthy classes, 
were built on a larger scale and fitted up in a 
more pretentious style. They were all flat- 
bottom boats. They sailed fairly well before 
the wind, but against it, they were either tracked 
by lines from the mast to the trackers on shore, 
or by sculling, at which the Chinese are adepts. 
They can give a boat a great speed by a pair of 
sculls resting on steel pivots that are fastened at 
the stern, one on each side, about the middle of 
the scull, with four men on each scull; the blades 
are made to play in the water astern, right and 
left, which pushes and sends the boat forward at 
a surprisingly rapid rate. But in recent years, 
steam has made its way into China and steam 
launches have superseded these native craft 
which are fast disappearing from the smooth 
waters of Kiangsu province very much as the 
fast sailing ships, known as Baltimore Clippers, 
that in the fifties and sixties were engaged in the 
East India and China trade, have been gradually 
swept from the ocean by steam. 

At the end of three days, I was landed in the 
historic city of Hangchau, which is the capital 
of Chehkiang. It is situated on a plain of un- 
even ground, with hills in the southwest and west, 
and northeast. It covers an area of about three 
or four square miles. It is of a rectangular shape, 
Its length is from north to south; its breadth, 
from east to west. On the west, lies the Si-Hoo 
or West Lake, a beautiful sheet of limpid 
water with a gravelly or sandy bottom, stretch- 
ing from the foot of the city wall to the foot of 
the mountains which appear in the distance in 
the rear, rising into the clouds like lofty bul- 
warks guarding the city on the north. 

The Tsientang River, about two miles distant, 
flanks the city on the east. It takes its rise from 
the high mountain range of Hwui Chow in the 
southeast and follows a somewhat irregular 
course to the bay of the same name, and rushes 
down the rocky declivities like a foaming steed 
and empties itself into the bay about forty miles 
east of the city. This is one of the rivers that 
have periodical bores in which the tidal waters in 
their entrance to the bay create a noise like thun- 
der, and the waves rise to the height of eight or 
ten feet. 

Hangchau, aside from her historic fame as 
having been the .seat of the government of the 
Sung Dynasty of the 12th and 13th centuries, 
has always maintained a wide reputation for fine 
buildings, public and private, such as temples, 
pagodas, mosques and bridges, which go to lend 
enchantment to the magnificent natural scenery 
with which she is singularly endowed. But 
latterly, age and the degeneration of the times 
have done their work of mischief. Her past glory 
is fast sinking into obscurity; she will never 
recover her former prestige, unless a new 
power arises to make her once more the capital 
of a regenerated government. 

On the 15th of March, I left Hangchau to 
ascend the Tsientang River, at a station called 
Kang Kow, or mouth of the river, ahout two 
miles east of the city, where boats were waiting 
for us. Several hundreds of these boats of a 
peculiar and unique type were riding near the 
estuary of the river. These boats are called Urh 
Woo, named after the district where they were 
built. They vary from fifty to one hundred feet 
in length, from stem to stern, and are ten or 
fifteen feet broad, and draw not more than two 
or three feet of water when fully loaded. They 
are all flat-bottom boats, built of the most limber 
and flexible material that can be found, as they 
are expected to meet strong currents and run 
against rocks, both in their ascent and descent, 
on account of the irregularity and rocky bottom 
of the river* These boats, when completely 
equipped and covered with bamboo matting, look 
like huge cylinders, and are shaped like cigars. 
The interior from stem to stern is divided into 
separate compartments, or rooms, in which 
bunks are built to accommodate passengers. 
These compartments and bunks are removed 
when room is needed for cargoes. These boats 
ply between Hangehau and Sheong Shan and 
do all the interior transportation by water be- 
tween these entrepots in Chehkiang and KiangsL 
Sheong Shan is the important station of Cheh- 
kiang, and Yuh-Shan is that of Kiangsl The 
distance between the two entrepots is about fifty 
lis, or about sixteen English miles, connected 
by one of the finest macadamized roads in China. 
The road is about thirty feet wide, paved with 
slabs of granite and flanked with greenish-colored 
cobbles. A fine stone arch which was erected as 
a land-mark of the boundary line separating 
Chehkiang and Kiangsi provinces, spans the 
whole width of the road. On both sides of the 
key-stone of the arch are carved four fine Chinese 
characters, painted in bright blue, viz., Leang 
Hsing Tung Chu: 

This is one of the most notable arch-ways 
through which the inter-provincial trade has been 
carried on for ages past. At the time when I 
crossed from Sheong Shan to Yuh-Shan, the 
river ports of Hankau, Kiukiang, Wuhu and 
Chinkiang were not opened to foreign trade 
and steam-boats had not come in to play their 
part in the carrying trade of the interior of 
China. This magnificent thoroughfare was 
crowded with thousands of porters bearing mer- 
chandise of all kinds to and fro exports and 
imports for distribution. It certainly presented 
an interesting sight to the traveller, as well as 
a profound topic of contemplation to a Chinese 
patriot. 

The opening of the Yangtze River, which is 
navigable as far as Kingchau, on the borders of 
Szechwan province, commanding the trade of at 
least six or seven provinces along its whole 
course of nearly three thousand miles to the 
ocean, presents a spectacle of unbounded possi- 
bilities for the amelioration of nearly a third of 
the human race, if only the grasping ambition of 
the West will let the territorial integrity and 
the independent sovereignty of China remain 
intact. Give the people of China a fair chance 
to work out the problems of their own salvation, 
as for instance the solution of the labor question, 
which has been so radically disorganized and 
broken up by steam, electricity and machinery. 
This has virtually taken the breath and bread 
away from nine-tenths of the people of China, 
and therefore this immovable mass of population 
should be given ample time to recover from its 
demoralization. 

To go back to my starting point at Kang 
Ivow, the entrance to the river, two miles east of 
Hangchau, we set sail, with a fair wind, at five 
o'clock in the morning of the 15th of March, 
and in the evening at ten o'clock we anchored 
at a place named the "Seven Dragons," after 
having made about one hundred miles during 
the day* The eastern shore in this part of the 
Tsientang River is evidently of red sandstone 
formation, for we could see part of the strata 
submerged in the water, and excavations of the 
stone may be seen strewn about on the shore. In 
fact, red sandstone buildings may be seen scat- 
tered about here and there. But the mountain 
about the Seven Dragons is picturesque and 
romantic. 

Early the next day, we again started, but the 
rain poured down in torrents. We kept on till 
we reached the town of Lan Chi and came to 
anchor in the evening, after having made about 
forty miles. This is the favorite entrepot where 
the Hupeh and Hunan congou teas were 
brought all the way from the tea districts of these 
provinces, to be housed and transhipped to 
Shanghai via Hangchau. Lan Chi is an 
entrepot of only one street, but Its entire length 
is six miles. It is famous for its nice hams, which 
are known all over China. On account of the 
incessant rain, we stopped half a day at Lan 
Chi. In the afternoon the sky began to clear 
and at twelve o'clock in the night we again 
started and reached the walled city of Ku Chow, 
which was besieged by the Taiping rebels in 
March, 1858, just a year before; after four 
months* duration the siege was raised and no 
great damage was done. We put up in an inn 
for the night. Ku Chow is a departmental city 
of Chehkiang and is about thirty miles distant 
from Sheong Shan, already mentioned in con- 
nection with Yuh-Shan. We were delayed by 
the Custom House officials, as well as on account 
of the scarcity of porters and chair-bearers to 
take us over to Sheong Shan. We arrived at 
Yuh-Shan from Sheong Shan by chair in the 
evening. We put up in an inn for the night, 
having first engaged fishing boats to take us to 
the city of Kwangshun, thirty miles from Yuh- 
Shan, the next morning. After reaching Yuh- 
Shan, we were in Kiangsi territory, and our 
route now lay in a west by north direction, down 
stream towards the Po Yang Lake, whose south- 
ern margin we passed, and reached Nan Cheong, 
the capital of Kiangsi province. The city pre- 
sented a fine outward appearance. We did not 
stop long enough to go through the city and see 
its actual condition since its evacuation by the 
rebels.

我第一次前往茶区之旅

1859年3月11日，我登上了一艘“吴式快”船。这种船是在吴江县建造的，吴江位于大运河边上，距离著名的苏州市不远。苏州是与杭州齐名的城市，以其财富、人口、丝织业及奢华生活而闻名。“快”字在中文中意为“快速”，因此，“吴式快”即指吴江所造的快速船。这些客船通常在江苏南部运河和湖泊水系附近的主要城市与市场之间往来，有各种尺寸，并精心布置，以方便乘客的舒适出行。专供官员或富人使用的船只则规模更大，装饰更为奢华。

这类船皆为平底船，顺风时航行良好，逆风时则需通过系在桅杆上的绳索由岸上的纤夫拖拉前进，或者依靠橹桨划动。中国人在划船方面技艺高超。他们可以用安装在船尾钢轴上的双橹使船达到极高速度。每侧一个橹桨，轴位于橹的中部，每个橹上有四人操作，橹叶在水中左右摆动，将船向前推进，速度惊人。近年来，蒸汽技术传入中国，蒸汽机船已逐渐取代这些传统船只，吴式快船正如19世纪五六十年代活跃于东印度与中国贸易航线的“巴尔的摩剪型帆船”一般，正逐渐从江苏省平静的水面上消失。

三天后，我抵达了历史名城杭州，即浙江省省会。杭州坐落于起伏的平原上，西南、西部与东北皆有群山环绕，城市面积约为三到四平方英里，呈长方形，南北为长、东西为宽。城市西侧是西湖，一片清澈透明、底部为砂砾的美丽湖泊，从城墙脚下延伸至远方的山脚，远山如屏障般高耸入云，宛如北方的天堑。

距城约两英里处，钱塘江自东侧流过。该江发源于东南方的徽州高山脉，蜿蜒曲折流入同名海湾，其水流湍急，如烈马奔腾，最终在距杭州约四十英里处汇入大海。此江以“钱塘潮”闻名，潮水涌入时如雷鸣轰响，浪高可达八至十尺。

杭州除了作为12至13世纪宋朝政府所在地而闻名外，还因其众多建筑而著称，包括庙宇、塔楼、清真寺与桥梁，为其得天独厚的自然景色增添光彩。然而，随着时代变迁和岁月侵蚀，这座城市的辉煌正逐渐消退。除非新的力量兴起，使其再次成为新政权的首都，否则她昔日的荣光恐将永不复现。

3月15日，我离开杭州，前往钱塘江上的一个名为“江口”的渡口，即杭州以东两英里处的江口码头。我们在那里登上了早已准备好的船。几百艘造型独特的船只停泊在河口，这些船称为“乌橹”，得名于其制造地“乌鲁”（今浙江南部一带）。这些船长约五十至一百英尺，宽十至十五英尺，满载时吃水不超过两三尺。它们全为平底结构，用最柔韧的材料建成，以便应对湍急水流与崎岖的河床。乌橹通常被竹席遮盖，外形如巨大雪茄，呈圆筒状。船内从前至后被分成多个舱室，设有床铺供乘客休息；若需运货，则可拆除这些舱室和床铺。这些船负责杭州与上山之间的内河运输，连接浙江与江西两地的中转站。

上山是浙江的重要中转点，而玉山则是江西的主要站点，两地相距约五十里，即十六英里。二者之间有一条中国最好的碎石公路相连，宽约三十英尺，以花岗岩石板铺就，辅以青色鹅卵石。路中有一道精美石拱门，为两省分界地标，门上两侧镌刻有四个醒目的蓝色大字：“两省通衢”。

这道石拱门是中国几百年来省际贸易的重要通道。当我从上山穿越至玉山时，汉口、九江、芜湖与镇江等长江港口尚未对外贸易开放，蒸汽船也尚未介入中国内陆运输。这条公路车水马龙，成千上万的挑夫来回运送各类商品，为进出口分发之用。这一幕对旅行者而言，是极为壮观的景象，对一位中国爱国者而言，更是一段值得深思的题材。

长江的开放，其水道可通至四川边境的荆州，掌控着沿途六至七省的贸易，绵延近三千英里直至大海，展现出难以估量的发展潜力。这对全人类三分之一人口的生活改善，意味着无限希望，只要西方的贪婪野心不破坏中国的领土完整与独立主权。只需给予中国人民公平的机会，使其自行解决自身的问题，例如因蒸汽、电力与机械的引入而严重受损的劳工问题。这些新技术实际上已剥夺了中国九成百姓的生计，因此，这一庞大的人口群体亟需时间来从混乱中恢复元气。

回到我们出发地江口，3月15日凌晨五点，我们在顺风中起航，日行百里，于晚上十点抵达一处名为“七龙”的地方抛锚休息。钱塘江东岸多为红砂岩地貌，河水中可见其沉积岩层，岸边亦散落着被开采的岩石，偶见以红砂岩建造的房屋。在七龙一带的山峦则尤为秀丽壮观，景色优美，颇具诗意。

翌日清晨，我们再次启程，恰遇大雨滂沱。我们冒雨前行，直到傍晚抵达兰溪镇停泊，全天行程约四十里。这里是湖北与湖南“工夫茶”（congou tea）中转的重要集散地，茶叶由原产地经长途跋涉运至此地，再转运至上海，经杭州中转。兰溪虽仅一街之镇，却绵延六英里，颇为出名，尤以火腿闻名全国。因大雨不断，我们在兰溪停留了半日，直至下午转晴。夜里十二点，我们再次出发，并于次日清晨抵达古城区“衢州”。该城于1858年3月曾遭太平军围攻，围城历时四月，最终解围，城市未受重创。我们当晚在一家客栈留宿。

衢州是浙江的一座府治城市，距离上山约三十里。因海关检查与缺少挑夫、轿夫，我们被耽搁了一段时间。后从上山出发乘轿至玉山，到达后即进入江西境内。我们当晚留宿在玉山客栈，并雇用了渔船，准备翌日清晨前往三十里外的广信府城。

从玉山开始，我们的路线朝西北方向顺流而下，途经鄱阳湖南岸，最终抵达江西省省会南昌。南昌城外观雄伟，我们因时间有限未能深入城中，了解自太平军撤退后的城市实况。






Our route from Nan Cheong was changed in 
a west by south direction, making the great 
entrepot of Siang Tan our final goal. In this 
route, we passed quite a number of large cities 
that had nothing of special importance, either 
commercially or historically, to relate. We 
passed Cheong Sha, the capital of Hunan, in 
the night. We arrived at Siang Tan on the 
morning of the 15th of April. Siang Tan is one 
of the noted entrepots in the interior of China 
and used to be the great distributing center of 
imports when foreign trade was confined to the 
single port of Canton. It was also the emporium 
where the tea and silk goods of China were 
centered and housed, to be carried down to 
Canton for exportation to foreign countries. 
The overland transport trade between Siang 
Tan and Canton was immense. It gave employ- 
ment to at least one hundred thousand porters, 
carrying merchandise over the Nan Fung pass, 
between the two cities, and supported a large 
population along both sides of the thoroughfare. 

Steam, wars and treaties of very recent dates 
have not only broken up this system of labor 
and changed the complexion of the whole labor 
question throughout China, but will also alter 
the economical, industrial and political condi- 
tions of the Chinese Empire during the coming 
years of her history. 

At Siang Tan, our whole party, composed of 
tea-men, was broken up and each batch began 
its journey to the district assigned it, to begin 
the work of purchasing raw tea and preparing it 
to be packed for shipment in Shanghai. 

I stayed in Siang Tan about ten days and 
then made preparations for a trip up to the 
department of Kingchau in Hupeh province, to 
look into the yellow silk produced in a district 
called Ho- Yung. 

We left Siang Tan on the 26th of April, and 
proceeded northward to our place of destination. 
Next morning at eight o'clock we reached 
Cheong Sha, the capital of Hunan province. As 
the day was wet and gloomy, we stopped and 
tried to make the best of it by going inside of the 
city to see whether there was anything worth 
seeing, but like all Chinese cities, it presented 
the same monotonous appearance of age and 
filth, the same unchangeable style of architecture 
and narrow streets. Early next morning, we 
resumed our boat journey, crossed the Tung 
Ting Lake and the great river Yangtze till we 
entered the mouth of the King Ho which carried 
us to Ho Yung. On this trip to hunt after the 
yellow silk not the golden fleece we were 
thirteen days from Siang Tan. The country on 
both banks of the King Ho seemed quiet and 
peaceful and people were engaged in agricul- 
tural pursuits. We saw many buffaloes and 
donkeys, and large patches of wheat, inter- 
spersed with beans. A novel sight presented 
itself which I have never met with elsewhere in 
China. A couple of country lassies were riding 
on a donkey, and were evidently in a happy 
mood, laughing and talking as they rode by. 
Arriving in Ho Yung, we had some difficulty in 
finding an inn, but finally succeeded in securing 
quarters in a silk hong. No sooner were we 
safely quartered, than a couple of native con- 
stables called to know who we were; our names 
and business were taken down. Our host, the 
proprietor of the hong, who knew the reason 
of our coming, explained things to the satisfac- 
tion of the men, who went away perfectly 
satisfied that we were honest traders and no 
rebel spies. We were left to transact our busi- 
ness unmolested* As soon as our object was 
known, numerous samples of yellow silk were 
brought for our inspection. We selected quite 
a number of samples, which altogether weighed 
about sixty-five pounds, and had them packed 
to be taken to Shanghai. 

At the end of a fortnight, we concluded to take 
our journey back. Accordingly, on the 26th of 
May we bade Ho Yung farewell, and started 
for the tea district of Mh Kia Shi, in the 
department of Oheong Sha, via Hankau. We 
arrived at Hankau on the 5th of June, and put 
up in a native inn. The weather was hot and 
muggy, and our quarters were narrow and cut 
off from fresh air. Three days after our arrival, 
three deputies visited us to find out who we were. 
It did not take long to convince them that we 
were not rebel spies. We showed them the 
package of yellow silk, which bore marks of a 
war-tax which we had to pay on it, all along the 
route from Ho Yung to Hankau. We were 
left unmolested. 

The port of Hankau had not been opened for 
foreign trade, though it was well understood 
that it was to be opened very soon. Before its 
capture by the Taiping rebels, or rather before 
the Taiping rebels had made their appearance 
on the stage of action, Hankau was the most 
important entrepot in China. When the 
Taiping rebels captured Woochang in 1856, 
Hankau and Han Yang fell at the same time, 
and the port was destroyed by fire and was 
reduced to ashes. At the time of my visit, the 
whole place was rebuilt and trade began to 
revive. But the buildings were temporary 
shifts, Now the character of the place is com- 
pletely changed and the foreign residences and 
warehouses along the water's edge have given 
it altogether a European aspect, so that the 
Hankau of today may be regarded as the 
Chicago or St. Louis of China, and in no distant 
day she is destined to surpass both in trade, 
population and wealth. I was in Hankau a few 
days before I crossed the Yangtze-Kiang to the 
black tea district of Nih Kia Shi. 

We left Hankau on the 30th of June and 
went over to the tea packing houses in Nih Kia 
Shi and Yang Liu Tung on the 4th of July. I 
was in those two places over a month and gained 
a complete knowledge of the whole process of 
preparing the black tea for the foreign market. 
The process is very simple and can be easily 
learned. I do not know through what prepara- 
tions the Indian and Assam teas have to 
go, where machinery Is used, but they cannot 
be very elaborate. Undoubtedly, since the 
fifties, manual labor, the old standby in pre- 
paring teas for foreign consumption, has been 
much improved with a view of retaining a large 
percentage of the tea trade in China. The 
reason why a large percentage of the tea busi- 
ness has passed away from China to India is not 
because machinery is used in the one case and 
manual labor is retained in the other, but chiefly 
on account of the quality of the tea that is raised 
in the different soil of the two countries. The 
Indian or Assam tea is much stronger (in 
proportion to the same quantity) than the 
Chinese tea. The Indian tea is 2-1 to Chinese 
tea, in point of strength, whereas the Chinese 
ta is 2-1 to the Indian tea in point of 
delicacy and flavor. The Indian is rank and 
strong, but the Chinese tea is superior in the 
quality of its fine aroma. The higher class of 
tea-drinkers in America, Europe and Russia 
prefer China tea to Indian, whereas the laboring 
and common class in those countries take to 
Indian and Assam, from the fact that they are 
stronger and cheaper. 

In the latter part of August I decided to 
return to Shanghai, not by way of Siang Tan, 
but via Hankau, down the Yangtze River to 
Kiu Kang and across the Poh Yang Lake* I 
arrived at Hankau again the second time on the 
29th of August, having left there two months 
previous, in July. This time I came in a Hunan 
junk loaded with tea for Shanghai. At Ho 
Kow, the southern shore of the Poh Yang Lake, 
I had to follow the same route I took in March, 
and on the 21st of September I landed at Hang- 
chau and from there I took a Woo-Sik-Kwei 
for Shanghai, where I arrived in the night 
of the 30th of September, the time consumed 
on this journey having been seven months 
from March to October. It was my first journey 
into the interior of China, and it gave me a 
chance to gain an insight into the actual condition 
of the people, while a drastic rebellion was going 
on in their midst. The zone of the country 
through which I had passed had been visited by 
the rebels and the imperialists, but was, to all out- 
ward appearance, peaceful and quiet. To what 
extent the people had suffered both from rebel 
and imperialist devastations in those sections of 
the country, no one can tell. But there was one 
significant fact that struck me forcibly and that 
was the sparseness of population, which was at 
variance with my preconceived notions regarding 
the density of population in China which I had 
gathered from books and accounts of travelers. 
This was particularly noticeable through that 
section of Chehkiang, Kiangsi, Hunan and 
Hupeh, which I visited. The time of the year, 
when crops of all kinds needed to be planted, 
should have brought out the peasantry into the 
open fields with oxen, mules, donkeys, buffaloes 
and horses, as indispensable accessories to farm 
life. But comparatively few farmers were met 
with. 

Shortly after my arrival from the interior, in 
October, an English friend of mine requested 
me to go to Shau Hing to buy raw silk for him. 
Shau Hing is a city located in a silk district 
about twenty miles southwest of Hangchau, and 
noted for its fine quality of silk. I was about 
two months in this business, when I was taken 
down with fever and ague and was compelled 
to give it up. Shau Hing, like most Chinese 
cities, was filthy and unhealthy and the water 
that flowed through it was as black as ink. The 
city was built in the lowest depression of a valley, 
and the outlet of the river was so blocked that 
there was hardly any current to carry off the 
filth that had been accumulating for ages. 
Hence the city was literally located in a cess- 
pool a breeding place for fever and ague, and 
epidemics of all kinds. But I soon recovered 
from the attack of the fever and ague and as 
soon as I could stand on my legs again, I imme- 
diately left the malarial atmosphere, and was, 
in a short time, breathing fresher and purer air. 


我们从南昌出发的路线改为西偏南方向，最终目标是中国内陆著名的商埠湘潭。在这一路上，我们经过了许多大城市，但这些城市在商业或历史上都没有特别重要的事情可以叙述。我们在夜间经过了湖南省省会长沙。我们于四月十五日早晨抵达湘潭。湘潭是中国内陆著名的转运中心之一，曾是外贸仅限于广州一港时期的重要进口分销中心。它也是中国茶叶和丝绸商品的集散地，这些货物在此集中存放，然后运往广州出口至外国。湘潭与广州之间的陆路运输业曾非常繁盛，至少雇佣了十万名挑夫，穿越南风岭运输货物，沿途两侧也因此养活了大量人口。

蒸汽、战争和最近的条约不仅打破了这种劳工制度，也彻底改变了中国全国的劳动状况，同时还将在未来的历史中，改变中华帝国的经济、工业和政治格局。

在湘潭，我们的整个商队——一群茶叶商人——被分开了，各自前往分配到的地区，开始采购毛茶并准备将其包装好，运往上海。

我在湘潭停留了大约十天，然后开始准备前往湖北省荆州府，考察一个叫“禾涌”的地区所产的黄丝。

我们于四月二十六日离开湘潭，向北前往目的地。第二天早上八点钟，我们到达了湖南省会长沙。当天阴雨连绵，我们便停了下来，试图进城看看是否有值得一看的东西，但如同所有的中国城市，这里呈现出的仍是千篇一律的陈旧与肮脏、千年不变的建筑风格和狭窄的街道。第二天一早，我们继续乘船前行，穿越洞庭湖和长江，进入荆河的河口，驶向禾涌。这趟寻找黄丝而非金羊毛的旅程，我们从湘潭出发用了十三天。荆河两岸的乡村看起来安宁平和，人们忙于耕作。我们看到许多水牛和驴子，还有大片麦田，间杂着豆田。有一幕新奇的景象让我印象深刻——两个乡村少女骑在一头驴上，显然心情愉快，一边说笑一边经过我们。

到了禾涌，我们在找旅馆时遇到了一些困难，但最终在一家丝行里找到了落脚处。我们刚安顿下来，就有两名本地巡捕上门盘问我们的身份；我们的姓名和来意都被登记在册。店主是这家丝行的主人，他知道我们此行的目的，便向他们解释清楚，使他们相信我们是诚实的商人，而非反贼间谍。于是我们可以安心做事，不再受到打扰。我们的目的一旦明了，就有很多黄丝样品送来让我们挑选。我们选中了不少样品，总重约六十五磅，并将其包装好准备运往上海。

在此停留了两周后，我们决定返程。于是我们于五月二十六日离开禾涌，启程前往长沙府的米家市茶区，中途经由汉口。我们于六月五日抵达汉口，住进了一家本地旅馆。天气闷热潮湿，我们住的房间狭小而且空气不流通。我们到达三天后，有三位官员来访，查问我们的身份。他们很快就确信我们不是反贼间谍。我们向他们出示了那批黄丝包裹，上面盖有我们沿路从禾涌到汉口一路缴纳战时税收的印记。他们便不再打扰我们。

当时汉口尚未开放对外贸易，尽管众所周知，它即将开埠。在太平军出现之前，或者说在太平军登上历史舞台之前，汉口是中国最重要的内陆商埠。太平军于1856年攻占武昌时，汉口和汉阳也同时沦陷，该港口在战火中被焚毁，化为灰烬。我访问时，整个城市已重建，商业开始复苏。但当时的建筑仍属临时搭建。如今汉口的面貌已焕然一新，水岸沿线的外国人住宅和仓库赋予它完全欧洲化的外观。因此，今天的汉口可以看作是中国的芝加哥或圣路易斯，并将在不久的将来，在贸易、人口和财富上超过这两座城市。我在汉口短暂停留几天后，便横渡长江前往黑茶产区——米家市。

我们于六月三十日离开汉口，七月四日到达米家市和杨柳垌的茶叶加工地。我在这两个地方逗留了一个多月，全面了解了为外销市场加工红茶的全过程。这一过程十分简单，易学易懂。我不知道印度和阿萨姆的茶叶在制茶过程中需要经过哪些机械处理，但相信也不会太复杂。自五十年代以来，传统依赖手工操作的中国制茶工艺已大为改进，以图保住中国茶叶在国际市场上的份额。中国失去大部分茶叶市场，并非因为印度使用了机器而中国仍保留手工操作，而主要原因是两国土壤不同，产出的茶叶质量有别。印度和阿萨姆的茶（同量对比）比中国茶更为浓烈；以浓度而论，印度茶为中国茶的二比一；而以香气与细致度而言，中国茶又胜印度茶二比一。印度茶气味浓烈，口感强劲，而中国茶则以清香细腻取胜。欧美和俄国的高阶茶客多偏爱中国茶；而工人阶级和一般群众则倾向于印度或阿萨姆茶，因为它们价格便宜且味道强烈。

八月底，我决定返回上海，但不再经由湘潭，而是从汉口顺长江而下，经九江横渡鄱阳湖。我于八月二十九日再次抵达汉口，此前于七月曾离开此地。这次我搭乘一艘满载运往上海的茶叶湖南货船。到达鄱阳湖南岸的湖口后，我便继续走三月份曾走过的路线，九月二十一日抵达杭州，然后乘坐乌锡归船赴上海，终于在九月三十日夜晚抵达。整个旅程从三月出发到十月结束，历时七个月。这是我第一次进入中国内地，让我有机会深入了解中国百姓在叛乱期间的真实处境。虽然我所经过的地区曾经受到过反贼和官军的交战波及，但表面上却呈现出一片和平宁静的景象。至于百姓在战火中所遭受的痛苦究竟有多深，没有人能确切说明。但有一点深深地触动了我，那就是人口的稀少，远远低于我从书本和旅行者描述中得出的对中国人口稠密的印象。这种情况在我访问的浙江、江西、湖南和湖北部分地区尤为明显。按说此时正是各类农作物需要播种的季节，应该看到大量农民带着牛、骡、驴、水牛和马出现在田野间——这些都是农业生活中不可或缺的伙伴。但事实上，我遇到的农民却寥寥无几。

十月我刚从内地返回不久，一位英国朋友请我去绍兴为他采购生丝。绍兴是一个位于杭州西南二十英里的丝绸产区，以出产优质丝绸而著称。我在那里从事此项业务约两个月，却不幸染上了疟疾和寒热病，不得不中止工作。绍兴如同大多数中国城市一样，又脏又不健康，城中水渠如墨水般黑。整个城市建在一处山谷的最低洼地，河道出口几乎被堵死，水流缓慢，无法冲走积存多年的污秽。因此，这座城市几乎就建在一个巨大的粪池之上，是疟疾、寒热病以及各种传染病的滋生之地。但我很快从病中恢复，等我重新能站起来时，我便立刻离开这个充满瘴气的地方，很快便呼吸到了清新洁净的空气。
