CHAPTER IX 

MY FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA 
DISTRICTS 

On the llth of March, 1859, I found myself 
on board of a Woo-Sik-Kwei, a Chinese boat 
built in Woo-Sik, a city situated on the borders 
of the Grand Canal, within a short distance of 
the famous city of Suchau a rival of the city of 
Hangchau, for wealth, population, silk manu- 
facture, and luxury. The word "Kwei" means 
"fast." Therefore, Woo-Sik-Kwei means fast 
boats of Woo-Sik. These passenger boats which 
plied between the principal cities and marts 
situated near the waters of the canal and lake 
system in southern Kianksu, were usually built 
of various sizes and nicely fitted up for the com- 
fort and convenience of the public. Those 
intended for officials, and the wealthy classes, 
were built on a larger scale and fitted up in a 
more pretentious style. They were all flat- 
bottom boats. They sailed fairly well before 

the wind, but against it, they were either tracked 

79 



80 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

by lines from the mast to the trackers on shore, 
or by sculling, at which the Chinese are adepts. 
They can give a boat a great speed by a pair of 
sculls resting on steel pivots that are fastened at 
the stern, one on each side, about the middle of 
the scull, with four men on each scull; the blades 
are made to play in the water astern, right and 
left, which pushes and sends the boat forward at 
a surprisingly rapid rate. But in recent years, 
steam has made its way into China and steam 
launches have superseded these native craft 
which are fast disappearing from the smooth 
waters of Kiangsu province very much as the 
fast sailing ships, known as Baltimore Clippers, 
that in the fifties and sixties were engaged in the 
East India and China trade, have been gradually 
swept from the ocean by steam. 

At the end of three days, I was landed in the 
historic city of Hangchau, which is the capital 
of Chehkiang. It is situated on a plain of un- 
even ground, with hills in the southwest and west, 
and northeast. It covers an area of about three 
or four square miles. It is of a rectangular shape, 
Its length is from north to south; its breadth, 
from east to west. On the west, lies the Si-Hoo 
or West Lake, a beautiful sheet of limpid 
water with a gravelly or sandy bottom, stretch- 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 81 

ing from the foot of the city wall to the foot of 
the mountains which appear in the distance in 
the rear, rising into the clouds like lofty bul- 
warks guarding the city on the north. 

The Tsientang River, about two miles distant, 
flanks the city on the east. It takes its rise from 
the high mountain range of Hwui Chow in the 
southeast and follows a somewhat irregular 
course to the bay of the same name, and rushes 
down the rocky declivities like a foaming steed 
and empties itself into the bay about forty miles 
east of the city. This is one of the rivers that 
have periodical bores in which the tidal waters in 
their entrance to the bay create a noise like thun- 
der, and the waves rise to the height of eight or 
ten feet. 

Hangchau, aside from her historic fame as 
having been the .seat of the government of the 
Sung Dynasty of the 12th and 13th centuries, 
has always maintained a wide reputation for fine 
buildings, public and private, such as temples, 
pagodas, mosques and bridges, which go to lend 
enchantment to the magnificent natural scenery 
with which she is singularly endowed. But 
latterly, age and the degeneration of the times 
have done their work of mischief. Her past glory 
is fast sinking into obscurity; she will never 



82 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

recover her former prestige, unless a new 
power arises to make her once more the capital 
of a regenerated government. 

On the 15th of March, I left Hangchau to 
ascend the Tsientang River, at a station called 
Kang Kow, or mouth of the river, ahout two 
miles east of the city, where boats were waiting 
for us. Several hundreds of these boats of a 
peculiar and unique type were riding near the 
estuary of the river. These boats are called Urh 
Woo, named after the district where they were 
built. They vary from fifty to one hundred feet 
in length, from stem to stern, and are ten or 
fifteen feet broad, and draw not more than two 
or three feet of water when fully loaded. They 
are all flat-bottom boats, built of the most limber 
and flexible material that can be found, as they 
are expected to meet strong currents and run 
against rocks, both in their ascent and descent, 
on account of the irregularity and rocky bottom 
of the river* These boats, when completely 
equipped and covered with bamboo matting, look 
like huge cylinders, and are shaped like cigars. 
The interior from stem to stern is divided into 
separate compartments, or rooms, in which 
bunks are built to accommodate passengers. 
These compartments and bunks are removed

when room is needed for cargoes. These boats 
ply between Hangehau and Sheong Shan and 
do all the interior transportation by water be- 
tween these entrepots in Chehkiang and KiangsL 
Sheong Shan is the important station of Cheh- 
kiang, and Yuh-Shan is that of Kiangsl The 
distance between the two entrepots is about fifty 
lis, or about sixteen English miles, connected 
by one of the finest macadamized roads in China. 
The road is about thirty feet wide, paved with 
slabs of granite and flanked with greenish-colored 
cobbles. A fine stone arch which was erected as 
a land-mark of the boundary line separating 
Chehkiang and Kiangsi provinces, spans the 
whole width of the road. On both sides of the 
key-stone of the arch are carved four fine Chinese 
characters, painted in bright blue, viz., Leang 
Hsing Tung Chu: 



This is one of the most notable arch-ways 
through which the inter-provincial trade has been 
carried on for ages past. At the time when I 
crossed from Sheong Shan to Yuh-Shan, the 
river ports of Hankau, Kiukiang, Wuhu and 
Chinkiang were not opened to foreign trade 



8* MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and steam-boats had not come in to play their 
part in the carrying trade of the interior of 
China. This magnificent thoroughfare was 
crowded with thousands of porters bearing mer- 
chandise of all kinds to and fro exports and 
imports for distribution. It certainly presented 
an interesting sight to the traveller, as well as 
a profound topic of contemplation to a Chinese 
patriot. 

The opening of the Yangtze River, which is 
navigable as far as Kingchau, on the borders of 
Szechwan province, commanding the trade of at 
least six or seven provinces along its whole 
course of nearly three thousand miles to the 
ocean, presents a spectacle of unbounded possi- 
bilities for the amelioration of nearly a third of 
the human race, if only the grasping ambition of 
the West will let the territorial integrity and 
the independent sovereignty of China remain 
intact. Give the people of China a fair chance 
to work out the problems of their own salvation, 
as for instance the solution of the labor question, 
which has been so radically disorganized and 
broken up by steam, electricity and machinery. 
This has virtually taken the breath and bread 
away from nine-tenths of the people of China, 
and therefore this immovable mass of population 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 85 

should be given ample time to recover from its 
demoralization. 

To go back to my starting point at Kang 
Ivow, the entrance to the river, two miles east of 
Hangchau, we set sail, with a fair wind, at five 
o'clock in the morning of the 15th of March, 
and in the evening at ten o'clock we anchored 
at a place named the "Seven Dragons," after 
having made about one hundred miles during 
the day* The eastern shore in this part of the 
Tsientang River is evidently of red sandstone 
formation, for we could see part of the strata 
submerged in the water, and excavations of the 
stone may be seen strewn about on the shore. In 
fact, red sandstone buildings may be seen scat- 
tered about here and there. But the mountain 
about the Seven Dragons is picturesque and 
romantic. 

Early the next day, we again started, but the 
rain poured down in torrents. We kept on till 
we reached the town of Lan Chi and came to 
anchor in the evening, after having made about 
forty miles. This is the favorite entrepot where 
the Hupeh and Hunan congou teas were 
brought all the way from the tea districts of these 
provinces, to be housed and transhipped to 
Shanghai via Hangchau. Lan Chi is an 



86 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

entrepot of only one street, but Its entire length 
is six miles. It is famous for its nice hams, which 
are known all over China. On account of the 
incessant rain, we stopped half a day at Lan 
Chi. In the afternoon the sky began to clear 
and at twelve o'clock in the night we again 
started and reached the walled city of Ku Chow, 
which was besieged by the Taiping rebels in 
March, 1858, just a year before; after four 
months* duration the siege was raised and no 
great damage was done. We put up in an inn 
for the night. Ku Chow is a departmental city 
of Chehkiang and is about thirty miles distant 
from Sheong Shan, already mentioned in con- 
nection with Yuh-Shan. We were delayed by 
the Custom House officials, as well as on account 
of the scarcity of porters and chair-bearers to 
take us over to Sheong Shan. We arrived at 
Yuh-Shan from Sheong Shan by chair in the 
evening. We put up in an inn for the night, 
having first engaged fishing boats to take us to 
the city of Kwangshun, thirty miles from Yuh- 
Shan, the next morning. After reaching Yuh- 
Shan, we were in Kiangsi territory, and our 
route now lay in a west by north direction, down 
stream towards the Po Yang Lake, whose south- 
ern margin we passed, and reached Nan Cheong, 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 87 

the capital of Kiangsi province. The city pre- 
sented a fine outward appearance. We did not 
stop long enough to go through the city and see 
its actual condition since its evacuation by the 
rebels* 

Our route from Nan Cheong was changed in 
a west by south direction, making the great 
entrepot of Siang Tan our final goal. In this 
route, we passed quite a number of large cities 
that had nothing of special importance, either 
commercially or historically, to relate. We 
passed Cheong Sha, the capital of Hunan, in 
the night. We arrived at Siang Tan on the 
morning of the 15th of April. Siang Tan is one 
of the noted entrepots in the interior of China 
and used to be the great distributing center of 
imports when foreign trade was confined to the 
single port of Canton. It was also the emporium 
where the tea and silk goods of China were 
centered and housed, to be carried down to 
Canton for exportation to foreign countries. 
The overland transport trade between Siang 
Tan and Canton was immense. It gave employ- 
ment to at least one hundred thousand porters, 
carrying merchandise over the Nan Fung pass, 
between the two cities, and supported a large 
population along both sides of the thoroughfare. 



88 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Steam, wars and treaties of very recent dates 
have not only broken up this system of labor 
and changed the complexion of the whole labor 
question throughout China, but will also alter 
the economical, industrial and political condi- 
tions of the Chinese Empire during the coming 
years of her history. 

At Siang Tan, our whole party, composed of 
tea-men, was broken up and each batch began 
its journey to the district assigned it, to begin 
the work of purchasing raw tea and preparing it 
to be packed for shipment in Shanghai. 

I stayed in Siang Tan about ten days and 
then made preparations for a trip up to the 
department of Kingchau in Hupeh province, to 
look into the yellow silk produced in a district 
called Ho- Yung. 

We left Siang Tan on the 26th of April, and 
proceeded northward to our place of destination. 
Next morning at eight o'clock we reached 
Cheong Sha, the capital of Hunan province. As 
the day was wet and gloomy, we stopped and 
tried to make the best of it by going inside of the 
city to see whether there was anything worth 
seeing, but like all Chinese cities, it presented 
the same monotonous appearance of age and 
filth, the same unchangeable style of architecture 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 89 

and narrow streets* Early next morning, we 
resumed our boat journey, crossed the Tung 
Ting Lake and the great river Yangtze till we 
entered the mouth of the King Ho which carried 
us to Ho Yung. On this trip to hunt after the 
yellow silk not the golden fleece we were 
thirteen days from Siang Tan. The country on 
both banks of the King Ho seemed quiet and 
peaceful and people were engaged in agricul- 
tural pursuits. We saw many buffaloes and 
donkeys, and large patches of wheat, inter- 
spersed with beans. A novel sight presented 
itself which I have never met with elsewhere in 
China. A couple of country lassies were riding 
on a donkey, and were evidently in a happy 
mood, laughing and talking as they rode by. 
Arriving in Ho Yung, we had some difficulty in 
finding an inn, but finally succeeded in securing 
quarters in a silk hong. No sooner were we 
safely quartered, than a couple of native con- 
stables called to know who we were; our names 
and business were taken down. Our host, the 
proprietor of the hong, who knew the reason 
of our coming, explained things to the satisfac- 
tion of the men, who went away perfectly 
satisfied that we were honest traders and no 
rebel spies. We were left to transact our busi- 



90 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

ness unmolested* As soon as our object was 
known, numerous samples of yellow silk were 
brought for our inspection. We selected quite 
a number of samples, which altogether weighed 
about sixty-five pounds, and had them packed 
to be taken to Shanghai. 

At the end of a fortnight, we concluded to take 
our journey back. Accordingly, on the 26th of 
May we bade Ho Yung farewell, and started 
for the tea district of Mh Kia Shi, in the 
department of Oheong Sha, via Hankau. We 
arrived at Hankau on the 5th of June, and put 
up in a native inn. The weather was hot and 
muggy, and our quarters were narrow and cut 
off from fresh air. Three days after our arrival, 
three deputies visited us to find out who we were. 
It did not take long to convince them that we 
were not rebel spies. We showed them the 
package of yellow silk, which bore marks of a 
war-tax which we had to pay on it, all along the 
route from Ho Yung to Hankau. We were 
left unmolested. 

The port of Hankau had not been opened for 
foreign trade, though it was well understood 
that it was to be opened very soon. Before its 
capture by the Taiping rebels, or rather before 
the Taiping rebels had made their appearance 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 91 

on the stage of action, Hankau was the most 
important entrepot in China. When the 
Taiping rebels captured Woochang in 1856, 
Hankau and Han Yang fell at the same time, 
and the port was destroyed by fire and was 
reduced to ashes. At the time of my visit, the 
whole place was rebuilt and trade began to 
revive. But the buildings were temporary 
shifts, Now the character of the place is com- 
pletely changed and the foreign residences and 
warehouses along the water's edge have given 
it altogether a European aspect, so that the 
Hankau of today may be regarded as the 
Chicago or St. Louis of China, and in no distant 
day she is destined to surpass both in trade, 
population and wealth. I was in Hankau a few 
days before I crossed the Yangtze-Kiang to the 
black tea district of Nih Kia Shi. 

We left Hankau on the 30th of June and 
went over to the tea packing houses in Nih Kia 
Shi and Yang Liu Tung on the 4th of July. I 
was in those two places over a month and gained 
a complete knowledge of the whole process of 
preparing the black tea for the foreign market. 
The process is very simple and can be easily 
learned. I do not know through what prepara- 
tions the Indian and Assam teas have to 



92 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

go, where machinery Is used, but they cannot 
be very elaborate. Undoubtedly, since the 
fifties, manual labor, the old standby in pre- 
paring teas for foreign consumption, has been 
much improved with a view of retaining a large 
percentage of the tea trade in China. The 
reason why a large percentage of the tea busi- 
ness has passed away from China to India is not 
because machinery is used in the one case and 
manual labor is retained in the other, but chiefly 
on account of the quality of the tea that is raised 
in the different soil of the two countries. The 
Indian or Assam tea is much stronger (in 
proportion to the same quantity) than the 
Chinese tea. The Indian tea is 2-1 to Chinese 
tea, in point of strength, whereas the Chinese 
ta is 2-1 to the Indian tea in point of 
delicacy and flavor. The Indian is rank and 
strong, but the Chinese tea is superior in the 
quality of its fine aroma. The higher class of 
tea-drinkers in America, Europe and Russia 
prefer China tea to Indian, whereas the laboring 
and common class in those countries take to 
Indian and Assam, from the fact that they are 
stronger and cheaper. 

In the latter part of August I decided to 
return to Shanghai, not by way of Siang Tan, 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 93 

but via Hankau, down the Yangtze River to 
Kiu Kang and across the Poh Yang Lake* I 
arrived at Hankau again the second time on the 
29th of August, having left there two months 
previous, in July. This time I came in a Hunan 
junk loaded with tea for Shanghai. At Ho 
Kow, the southern shore of the Poh Yang Lake, 
I had to follow the same route I took in March, 
and on the 21st of September I landed at Hang- 
chau and from there I took a Woo-Sik-Kwei 
for Shanghai, where I arrived in the night 
of the 30th of September, the time consumed 
on this journey having been seven months 
from March to October. It was my first journey 
into the interior of China, <and it gave me a 
chance to gain an insight into the actual condition 
of the people, while a drastic rebellion was going 
on in their midst. The zone of the country 
through which I had passed had been visited by 
the rebels and the imperialists, but was, to all out- 
ward appearance, peaceful and quiet. To what 
extent the people had suffered both from rebel 
and imperialist devastations in those sections of 
the country, no one can tell. But there was one 
significant fact that struck me forcibly and that 
was the sparseness of population, which was at 
variance with my preconceived notions regarding 



94 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the density of population in China which I had 
gathered from books and accounts of travelers. 
This was particularly noticeable through that 
section of Chehkiang, Kiangsi, Hunan and 
Hupeh, which I visited. The time of the year, 
when crops of all kinds needed to be planted, 
should have brought out the peasantry into the 
open fields with oxen, mules, donkeys, buffaloes 
and horses, as indispensable accessories to farm 
life. But comparatively few farmers were met 
with. 

Shortly after my arrival from the interior, in 
October, an English friend of mine requested 
me to go to Shau Hing to buy raw silk for him. 
Shau Hing is a city located in a silk district 
about twenty miles southwest of Hangchau, and 
noted for its fine quality of silk. I was about 
two months in this business, when I was taken 
down with fever and ague and was compelled 
to give it up. Shau Hing, like most Chinese 
cities, was filthy and unhealthy and the water 
that flowed through it was as black as ink. The 
city was built in the lowest depression of a valley, 
and the outlet of the river was so blocked that 
there was hardly any current to carry off the 
filth that had been accumulating for ages. 
Hence the city was literally located in a cess- 



FIRST TRIP TO THE TEA DISTRICTS 95 

pool a breeding place for fever and ague, and 
epidemics of all kinds. But I soon recovered 
from the attack of the fever and ague and as 
soon as I could stand on my legs again, I imme- 
diately left the malarial atmosphere, and was, 
in a short time, breathing fresher and purer air.
