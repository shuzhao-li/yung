CHAPTER XX 

JOURNEY TO PEKING AND DEATH 
OF MY WIFE 

The treatment which the students received at 
the hands of Chinese officials in the first years 
after their return to China as compared with the 
treatment they received in America while at 
school could not fail to make an impression upon 
their innermost convictions of the superiority 
of Occidental civilization over that of China 
an impression which will always appeal to them 
as cogent and valid ground for radical reforms 
in China, however altered their conditions may 
he in their subsequent careers. Quite a. number 
of the survivors of the one hundred students, I 
am happy to say, have risen to high official ranks 
and positions of great trust and responsibility. 
The eyes of the government have been opened 
to see the grand mistake it made in breaking 
up the Mission and having the students recalled. 
Within only a few years it had the candor and 
magnanimity to confess that it wished it had 

more of just such men as had been turned out

by the Chinese Educational Mission in Hart- 
ford, Conn. This confession, though coming too 
late, may be taken as a sure sign that China is 
really awakening and is making the best use of 
what few partially educated men are available. 
And these few Occidentally educated men have, 
in their turn, encouraged and stimulated both the 
government and the people. Since the memor- 
able events of the China and Japan war, and 
the war between Japan and Russia, several 
hundreds of Chinese students have come over to 
the United States to be educated. Thus the 
Chinese educational scheme which Tsang Kwoh 
Fan initiated in 1870 at Tientsin and established 
in Hartford, Conn., in 1872, though rolled back 
for a period of twenty-five years, has been prac- 
tically revived. 

Soon after the students' recall and return to 
China in 1881, I also took my departure and 
arrived in Tientsin in the fall of that year on my 
way to Peking to report myself to the govern- 
ment after my term of office as assistant minister 
had expired. This was the customary step for 
all diplomatic officers of the government to take 
at the close of their terms. Chin Lan Pin pre- 
ceded me by nearly a year, having returned in 
1880.

While paying my visit to Li Hung Chang in 
Tientsin, before going up to Peking, he brought 
up the subject of the recall of the students* To 
my great astonishment he asked me why I had 
allowed the students to return to China. Not 
knowing exactly the significance of the inquiry, 
I said that Chin Lan Pin, who was minister, had 
received an imperial decree to break up the Mis- 
sion; that His Excellency was in favor of the 
decree, so was Chin Lan Pin and so was Woo 
Tsze Tung. If I had stood out alone against 
carrying out the imperial mandate, would not I 
have been regarded as a rebel, guilty of treason, 
and lose my head for it? But he said that at 
heart he was in favor of their being kept in the 
States to continue their studies, and that I ought 
to have detained them. In reply I asked how I 
could have been supposed to read his heart at $ 
distance of 45,000 lis, especially when it was well 
known that His Excellency had said that they 
might just as well be recalled. If His Excel- 
lency had written to me beforehand not to break 
up the Mission under any circumstances, I would 
then have known what to do; as it was, I could 
not have done otherwise than to see the decree 
carried out. "Well," said he, in a somewhat 
angry and excited tone, "I know the author of

this great mischief " Woo Tsze Tung happened 
to be in Tientsin at the time. He had just been 
to Peking and sent me word begging me to call 
and see him. Out of courtesy, I did call. He 
told me he had not been well received in Peking, 
and that Viceroy Li was bitter towards him when 
he had called and had refused to see him a second 
time. He looked careworn and cast down. He 
was never heard of after our last interview. 

On my arrival in Peking, one of my first 
duties was to make my round of official calls on 
the leading dignitaries of the government the 
Princes Kung and Ching and the presidents of 
the six boards. It took me nearly a month to 
finish these official calls. Peking may be said 
to be a city of great distances, and the high 
officials live quite far apart from each other. 
The only conveyances that were used to go about 
from place to place were the mule carts. These 
were heavy, clumsy vehicles with an axle-tree run- 
ning right across under the body of a box, which 
was the carriage, and without springs to break 
the jolting, with two heavy wheels, one at each 
end of the axle. They were slow coaches, and 
with the Peking roads all cut up and seldom re- 
paired, you can imagine what traveling in those 
days meant. The dust and smell of the roads 



220 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

were something fearful. The dust was nothing 
but pulverized manure almost as black as ink. 
It was ground so fine by the millions of mule 
carts that this black stuff would fill one's eyes 
and ears and penetrate deep into the pores of 
one's skin, making it impossible to cleanse 
oneself with one washing. The neck, head and 
hands had to hare suitable coverings to keep off 
the dust. The water is brackish, making it diffi- 
cult to take off the dirt, thereby adding to the 
discomforts of living in Peking. 

I was in Peking about three months. While 
there, I found time to prepare a plan for the 
effectual suppression of the Indian opium trade 
in China and the extinction of the poppy cultiva- 
tion in China and India. This plan was submitted 
to the Chinese government to be carried out, but 
I was told by Whang Wen Shiu, the president 
of the Tsung Li Yamun (Foreign Affairs) , that 
for want of suitable men, the plan could not be 
entertained, and it was shelved for nearly a 
quarter of a century until recently when the sub- 
ject became an international question. 

I left Peking in 1882. After four months' 
residence in Shanghai, I returned to the United 
States on account of the health of my family. 

I reached home in the spring of 1883, and 



JOURNEY TO PEKING 221 

found my wife in a very low condition. She had 
lost the use of her voice and greeted me in a 
hoarse low whisper. I was thankful that I found 
her still living though much emaciated. In less 
than a month after my return, she began to pick 
up and felt more like herself. Doubtless, her 
declining health and suffering were brought on 
partly on account of my absence and her inex- 
pressible anxiety over the safety of my life. A 
missionary fresh from China happened to call 
on her a few days before my departure for China 
and told her that my going back to China was a 
hazardous step, as they would probably cut my 
head off on account of the Chinese Educational 
Mission. This piece of gratuitous information 
tended more to aggravate a mind already 
weighed down by poor health, and to have 
this gloomy foreboding added to her anxiety 
was more than she could bear. I was absent in 
China from my family this time nearly a year 
and a half, and I made up my mind that I would 
never leave it again under any conditions what- 
ever. My return in 1883 seemed to act on my 
wife's health and spirit like magic, as she grad- 
ually recovered strength enough to go up to 
Norfolk for the summer. The air up in Nor- 
folk was comparatively pure and more whole- 



82 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

some than in the Connecticut valley, and proved 
highly salubrious to her condition. At the close 
of the summer, she came back a different person 
from what she was when she went away, and I 
was much encouraged by her improved health. 
I followed up these changes of climate and air 
with the view of restoring her to her normal con- 
dition, taking her down to Atlanta, Georgia, 
one winter and to the Adirondacks another year. 
It seemed that these changes brought only 
temporary relief without any permanent recov- 
ery. In the winter of 1885, she began to show 
signs of a loss of appetite and expressed a desire 
for a change. Somerville, New Jersey, was 
recommended to her as a sanitarium. That was 
the last resort she went to for her health, for 
there she caught a cold which resulted in her 
death. She lingered there for nearly two months 
till she was brought home, and died of Bright's 
disease on the 28th of June, 1886. She was 
buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in the home lot 
I secured for that purpose. Her death made a 
great void in my after-life, which was irrepara- 
ble, but she did not leave me hopelessly deserted 
and alone; she left me two sons who are constant 
reminders of her beautiful life and character. 
They have proved to be my greatest comfort 



JOURNEY TO PEKING 223 

and solace in my declining years. They are most 
faithful, thoughtful and affectionate sons, and I 
am proud of their manly and earnest Christian 
characters. My gratitude to God for blessing 
me with two such sons will forever rise to heaven, 
an endless incense. 

The two blows that fell upon me one after the 
other within the short span of five years from 
1880 to 1886 were enough to crush my spirit. 
The one had scattered my life work to the four 
winds; the other had deprived me of a happy 
home which had lasted only ten years. The only 
gleam of light that broke through the dark 
clouds which hung over my head came from my 
two motherless sons whose tender years appealed 
to the very depths of my soul for care and sym- 
pathy. They were respectively seven and nine 
years old when deprived of their mother. I was 
both father and mother to them from 1886 till 
1895. My whole soul was wrapped up in their 
education and well-being. My mother-in-law, 
Mrs. Mary B. Kellogg, assisted me in my 
work and stood by me in my most trying hours, 
keeping house for me for nearly two years.
