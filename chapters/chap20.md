CHAPTER XX 

JOURNEY TO PEKING AND DEATH 
OF MY WIFE 

The treatment which the students received at 
the hands of Chinese officials in the first years 
after their return to China as compared with the 
treatment they received in America while at 
school could not fail to make an impression upon 
their innermost convictions of the superiority 
of Occidental civilization over that of China 
an impression which will always appeal to them 
as cogent and valid ground for radical reforms 
in China, however altered their conditions may 
he in their subsequent careers. Quite a. number 
of the survivors of the one hundred students, I 
am happy to say, have risen to high official ranks 
and positions of great trust and responsibility. 
The eyes of the government have been opened 
to see the grand mistake it made in breaking 
up the Mission and having the students recalled. 
Within only a few years it had the candor and 
magnanimity to confess that it wished it had 
more of just such men as had been turned out 
by the Chinese Educational Mission in Hartford, 
Conn. This confession, though coming too 
late, may be taken as a sure sign that China is 
really awakening and is making the best use of 
what few partially educated men are available. 
And these few Occidentally educated men have, 
in their turn, encouraged and stimulated both the 
government and the people. Since the memor- 
able events of the China and Japan war, and 
the war between Japan and Russia, several 
hundreds of Chinese students have come over to 
the United States to be educated. Thus the 
Chinese educational scheme which Tsang Kwoh 
Fan initiated in 1870 at Tientsin and established 
in Hartford, Conn., in 1872, though rolled back 
for a period of twenty-five years, has been prac- 
tically revived. 

Soon after the students' recall and return to 
China in 1881, I also took my departure and 
arrived in Tientsin in the fall of that year on my 
way to Peking to report myself to the govern- 
ment after my term of office as assistant minister 
had expired. This was the customary step for 
all diplomatic officers of the government to take 
at the close of their terms. Chin Lan Pin pre- 
ceded me by nearly a year, having returned in 
1880. 

While paying my visit to Li Hung Chang in 
Tientsin, before going up to Peking, he brought 
up the subject of the recall of the students* To 
my great astonishment he asked me why I had 
allowed the students to return to China. Not 
knowing exactly the significance of the inquiry, 
I said that Chin Lan Pin, who was minister, had 
received an imperial decree to break up the Mis- 
sion; that His Excellency was in favor of the 
decree, so was Chin Lan Pin and so was Woo 
Tsze Tung. If I had stood out alone against 
carrying out the imperial mandate, would not I 
have been regarded as a rebel, guilty of treason, 
and lose my head for it? But he said that at 
heart he was in favor of their being kept in the 
States to continue their studies, and that I ought 
to have detained them. In reply I asked how I 
could have been supposed to read his heart at $ 
distance of 45,000 lis, especially when it was well 
known that His Excellency had said that they 
might just as well be recalled. If His Excel- 
lency had written to me beforehand not to break 
up the Mission under any circumstances, I would 
then have known what to do; as it was, I could 
not have done otherwise than to see the decree 
carried out. "Well," said he, in a somewhat 
angry and excited tone, "I know the author of 
this great mischief " Woo Tsze Tung happened 
to be in Tientsin at the time. He had just been 
to Peking and sent me word begging me to call 
and see him. Out of courtesy, I did call. He 
told me he had not been well received in Peking, 
and that Viceroy Li was bitter towards him when 
he had called and had refused to see him a second 
time. He looked careworn and cast down. He 
was never heard of after our last interview. 

On my arrival in Peking, one of my first 
duties was to make my round of official calls on 
the leading dignitaries of the government the 
Princes Kung and Ching and the presidents of 
the six boards. It took me nearly a month to 
finish these official calls. Peking may be said 
to be a city of great distances, and the high 
officials live quite far apart from each other. 
The only conveyances that were used to go about 
from place to place were the mule carts. These 
were heavy, clumsy vehicles with an axle-tree run- 
ning right across under the body of a box, which 
was the carriage, and without springs to break 
the jolting, with two heavy wheels, one at each 
end of the axle. They were slow coaches, and 
with the Peking roads all cut up and seldom re- 
paired, you can imagine what traveling in those 
days meant. The dust and smell of the roads 
were something fearful. The dust was nothing 
but pulverized manure almost as black as ink. 
It was ground so fine by the millions of mule 
carts that this black stuff would fill one's eyes 
and ears and penetrate deep into the pores of 
one's skin, making it impossible to cleanse 
oneself with one washing. The neck, head and 
hands had to hare suitable coverings to keep off 
the dust. The water is brackish, making it diffi- 
cult to take off the dirt, thereby adding to the 
discomforts of living in Peking. 

I was in Peking about three months. While 
there, I found time to prepare a plan for the 
effectual suppression of the Indian opium trade 
in China and the extinction of the poppy cultiva- 
tion in China and India. This plan was submitted 
to the Chinese government to be carried out, but 
I was told by Whang Wen Shiu, the president 
of the Tsung Li Yamun (Foreign Affairs) , that 
for want of suitable men, the plan could not be 
entertained, and it was shelved for nearly a 
quarter of a century until recently when the sub- 
ject became an international question. 

I left Peking in 1882. After four months' 
residence in Shanghai, I returned to the United 
States on account of the health of my family. 

I reached home in the spring of 1883, and 
found my wife in a very low condition. She had 
lost the use of her voice and greeted me in a 
hoarse low whisper. I was thankful that I found 
her still living though much emaciated. In less 
than a month after my return, she began to pick 
up and felt more like herself. Doubtless, her 
declining health and suffering were brought on 
partly on account of my absence and her inex- 
pressible anxiety over the safety of my life. A 
missionary fresh from China happened to call 
on her a few days before my departure for China 
and told her that my going back to China was a 
hazardous step, as they would probably cut my 
head off on account of the Chinese Educational 
Mission. This piece of gratuitous information 
tended more to aggravate a mind already 
weighed down by poor health, and to have 
this gloomy foreboding added to her anxiety 
was more than she could bear. I was absent in 
China from my family this time nearly a year 
and a half, and I made up my mind that I would 
never leave it again under any conditions what- 
ever. My return in 1883 seemed to act on my 
wife's health and spirit like magic, as she grad- 
ually recovered strength enough to go up to 
Norfolk for the summer. The air up in Nor- 
folk was comparatively pure and more whole- 
some than in the Connecticut valley, and proved 
highly salubrious to her condition. At the close 
of the summer, she came back a different person 
from what she was when she went away, and I 
was much encouraged by her improved health. 
I followed up these changes of climate and air 
with the view of restoring her to her normal con- 
dition, taking her down to Atlanta, Georgia, 
one winter and to the Adirondacks another year. 
It seemed that these changes brought only 
temporary relief without any permanent recov- 
ery. In the winter of 1885, she began to show 
signs of a loss of appetite and expressed a desire 
for a change. Somerville, New Jersey, was 
recommended to her as a sanitarium. That was 
the last resort she went to for her health, for 
there she caught a cold which resulted in her 
death. She lingered there for nearly two months 
till she was brought home, and died of Bright's 
disease on the 28th of June, 1886. She was 
buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in the home lot 
I secured for that purpose. Her death made a 
great void in my after-life, which was irrepara- 
ble, but she did not leave me hopelessly deserted 
and alone; she left me two sons who are constant 
reminders of her beautiful life and character. 
They have proved to be my greatest comfort 
and solace in my declining years. They are most 
faithful, thoughtful and affectionate sons, and I 
am proud of their manly and earnest Christian 
characters. My gratitude to God for blessing 
me with two such sons will forever rise to heaven, 
an endless incense. 

The two blows that fell upon me one after the 
other within the short span of five years from 
1880 to 1886 were enough to crush my spirit. 
The one had scattered my life work to the four 
winds; the other had deprived me of a happy 
home which had lasted only ten years. The only 
gleam of light that broke through the dark 
clouds which hung over my head came from my 
two motherless sons whose tender years appealed 
to the very depths of my soul for care and sym- 
pathy. They were respectively seven and nine 
years old when deprived of their mother. I was 
both father and mother to them from 1886 till 
1895. My whole soul was wrapped up in their 
education and well-being. My mother-in-law, 
Mrs. Mary B. Kellogg, assisted me in my 
work and stood by me in my most trying hours, 
keeping house for me for nearly two years.

前往北京的旅程与妻子的去世

中国留美幼童在回国最初几年里，所受到中国官员的对待，与他们在美国读书期间所受的待遇相比，不能不在他们内心深处留下深刻的印象，加深他们对西方文明优越于中国文明的确信。无论他们日后的际遇如何变化，这种印象都将始终成为他们主张中国进行彻底改革的有力而正当的依据。令我欣慰的是，在这一百位学生中，有相当一部分幸存者已经跻身高位，肩负重任。中国政府也已认识到当初解散留美幼童计划、召回学生所犯下的严重错误。仅仅几年之后，政府已具备坦诚和宽宏之心，承认自己后悔未能培养出更多像那些在康涅狄格州哈特福德接受教育的学生那样的人才。虽然这番忏悔来得太晚，但它可以被视为中国真正觉醒的明确信号，也说明政府正在努力善用这为数不多的、受过部分西式教育的人才。而这些留洋归来的少数人也反过来鼓舞并推动了政府与人民。自中日甲午战争以及日俄战争这几场重要事件以来，已有数百名中国学生赴美接受教育。因此，曾由曾国藩于1870年在天津倡议、于1872年在康涅狄格州哈特福德设立的中国留美教育计划，虽曾中断二十五年，如今几乎得到了恢复。

在1881年学生们被召回、陆续返国之后不久，我也启程回国。同年秋天，我抵达天津，准备赴北京向政府报到，因我担任副使的任期已满。这是所有外交官员任期结束后惯常应履行的步骤。钦差大臣陈兰彬比我早近一年归国，于1880年回到中国。

在我赴北京前拜访李鸿章于天津时，他主动提及学生被召回一事。令我大感惊讶的是，他竟然问我，为何我允许学生返回中国。我不太明白他此话的用意，只答道：当时担任驻美大臣的陈兰彬接到一道解散留美幼童计划的谕旨，李中堂您本人也是赞成的，陈兰彬也同意，吴子登亦然。若我一人反对执行上谕，难道不会被视为抗命、犯上作乱，从而丢了性命吗？但李中堂却说，他内心其实是赞成学生继续留美读书的，他觉得我本该设法留住学生。对此我回应道：我又怎能在相距四万五千里之外知悉您的内心想法？何况当时众所周知，您也表示学生可以召回。若您当时曾写信给我，指示无论如何不得解散该计划，那我便知应如何行事；可事到临头，我别无选择，只能执行上命。李中堂听罢，情绪略显激动地说道：“我知道这场大祸的罪魁祸首是谁。”此时吴子登正好也在天津。他刚从北京回来，托人传话希望我去探望他。我出于礼节前去拜访。他告诉我此番进京不被善待，李中堂见他时态度冷淡，之后便拒不再见。他神情憔悴、心灰意冷。我们那次见面后，他便再无音讯。

我到达北京后，首要事务之一，便是对政府要员进行一一拜访，包括恭亲王奕訢、醇亲王奕譞以及六部尚书。这一轮正式拜访花去了我近一个月的时间。北京城地域广大，官员府邸之间相距甚远。出行所用交通工具只有骡车。这种车沉重笨拙，车轴横穿车厢底部，车厢形如方匣，车身无弹簧减震，轴两端各装一轮，极其颠簸缓慢。北京道路破损不堪，少有修整，可想而知当时的出行有多艰难。道路尘土飞扬，气味难闻，那尘土其实多为粉状粪土，几乎乌黑如墨。被无数骡车反复碾压，尘埃细密至极，会灌入眼耳、渗透皮肤，洗一次澡根本洗不干净。颈、头、手等部位必须有遮盖物以防尘土侵袭。更糟的是，北京水质咸涩，清洁效果不佳，生活诸多不便。

我在北京停留了大约三个月。其间，我拟定了一项有效制止印度鸦片走私入华、同时在中印两地根除罂粟种植的计划，呈交给中国政府实施。但总理衙门大臣黄文绣告知我，因缺乏合适人手，该计划暂无法执行，遂被搁置，直至近二十五年后，该议题才成为国际焦点。

我于1882年离京。又在上海居住四个月后，因家人健康缘故，我返回美国。

我于1883年春返家，发现妻子身体极度虚弱，失去了声音，只能用沙哑的低语与我交谈。尽管她瘦骨嶙峋，我仍感恩自己回到家时她尚在人世。在我返美不到一个月，她便逐渐恢复，有了些精神。显然，她的健康恶化与我的长期离家以及她对我安危的深切忧虑不无关系。在我动身赴华前几日，一位新近从中国回来的传教士曾拜访她，告知我此次返华凶险极大，极有可能因留美幼童计划之事而被处斩。这样无端的言语，无异于在她已因疾病而不安的心上再添阴影，使她的忧虑更加无法承受。这次我离家在外近一年半，回来后便暗自立誓，无论如何再不离家远行。

我于1883年回国后，她的病情有如神助地好转，逐渐恢复健康，甚至可以在夏季前往诺福克避暑。那里的空气相较康涅狄格河谷清新许多，对她身体极为有益。夏季结束时，她的身体状态大为改善，与出发前判若两人，令我十分欣慰。此后我继续尝试通过更换气候与环境以促其康复，曾带她去乔治亚州亚特兰大过冬，又于另一年去阿迪朗达克山区度夏。然而，这些气候变化似乎只能带来短暂的缓解，未能真正根治病情。1885年冬天，她食欲减退，表达了想换个环境的愿望。有人建议她前往新泽西州的萨默维尔休养。这成了她最后一次寻求疗养之地，却在那里染上风寒，最终导致死亡。她在那停留将近两个月，终被接回家中，于1886年6月28日因布赖特氏病病逝。我将她安葬在雪松山公墓的家族墓地，这是我特意为此购置的地块。

她的离世为我此后的人生留下了无法弥补的空虚。然而她并未让我孤单无依，她留给我两个儿子，时时提醒我她那美丽的人生与高贵的品格。他们成为我晚年最大的安慰与依靠。他们是忠诚、体贴、充满爱心的儿子，我为他们坚定而真挚的基督徒品格感到骄傲。对神赐予我如此儿子，我的感恩之心将永远向天而升，如香气袅袅，不绝不息。

从1880年到1886年这五年间，我接连遭受两次沉重打击，几乎摧毁了我的精神与意志。一次是我倾尽心血的事业被迫中止，风吹四散；另一次是我十年之久的幸福家庭支离破碎。唯一照亮我头顶乌云的一线微光，来自两个失去母亲的儿子。他们年幼无依的模样深深触动我心灵最柔软处，使我倍加怜惜呵护。失母时他们一个九岁，一个七岁。从那时起直到1895年，我既做父亲也做母亲，倾注全部身心于他们的教育与成长之中。我的岳母玛丽·B·凯洛格夫人也协助我，陪伴我度过最艰难的岁月，为我主持家务近两年。

京华行纪与丧妻之痛

这些留美幼童归国之初所受待遇，与他们在新英格兰受到的尊重判若云泥，这在他们心灵深处烙下了西方文明优越的印记——无论日后仕途如何，这种认知终将成为他们推动中国变革的深层动因。令人欣慰的是，百名归国幼童中多人已跻身要职。清政府终于醒悟当年撤局之误，公开表示"恨不多得此等人才"。虽属迟来的觉悟，却昭示着古老帝国的真正觉醒。自甲午、日俄两役后，数百名中国学子再度负笈西洋，曾国藩1870年开创、1872年实施而后中断二十五载的留学事业，终得赓续。

1881年秋，我在公使任期届满后返华述职。天津谒见李鸿章时，中堂竟劈头质问："何故听任学生归国？"我愕然答以"陈、吴二公与中堂俱奉谕旨，岂容下官独抗？"中堂悻然道："老夫本心原欲留其续学！"我暗叹：四万五千里外，如何揣摩上意？吴子登此时恰在津门，形容枯槁地告诉我，李中堂已拒其二次求见。此后此人便湮没无闻。

京中拜谒王公大臣的繁文缛节耗去我一月光阴。彼时北京堪称"驴车上的都城"——没有弹簧减震的双轮骡车碾过永远坑洼的街道，扬起墨黑色的粪土尘埃。这种由数百万次车轮研磨而成的细碎尘霾，能渗入肌肤纹理，即使用苦涩的井水反复擦洗也难以祛除。

居京三月间，我拟就禁绝印度鸦片及中土罂粟种植的方案。总理衙门大臣汪文焘却以"乏人可用"为由束之高阁，这一搁便是四分之一世纪。1882年离京后，因家人健康缘故，我于次年春返美，见妻子已病至失声，仅能以气音相迎。原来某传教士曾危言耸听，谓我返华恐遭不测，致她忧思成疾。我的归来似良药，令她渐能赴诺福克避暑疗养。此后我携她辗转佐治亚州与阿迪朗达克山区求医，终在1885年冬送她至新泽西疗养院——这成为最后旅程。1886年6月28日，她因肾炎长眠于雪松山墓园，留给我两个至宝般的儿子。

1880至1886这六年间接连两记重击——毕生事业毁于一旦，十年鹣鲽生死永诀——本足以摧垮任何人。幸有七岁与九岁的稚子，以他们基督徒的纯良品性，成为照破我生命阴翳的熹微晨光。岳母玛丽·凯洛格夫人襄助家务两载，使我得以全心教养二子，直至1895年他们长大成人。

（注："判若云泥"典出《后汉书》，喻差异悬殊；"四万五千里"保留原文"45,000 lis"的计量；"鹣鲽"用《尔雅》典故喻夫妻情深；****"照破阴翳的晨光"化用"晨光熹微"意象）
