CHAPTER XI 

REFLECTIONS ON THE TAIPING 
REBELLION 

Rebellions and revolutions in China are not 
new and rare historic occurrences. There have 
been at least twenty-four dynasties and as many 
attendant rebellions or revolutions. But with 
the exception of the Feudatory period, revolu- 
tions in China (since the consolidation of the 
three Kingdoms into one Empire under the 
Emperor Chin) meant only a change of hands 
in the government, without a change either of 
its form, or principles. Hence the history of 
China for at least two thousand years, like her 
civilization, bears the national impress of a 
monotonous dead level jejune in character, 
wanting in versatility of genius, and almost 
devoid of historic inspiration. 

The Taiping Rebellion differs from its pre- 
decessors in that in its embryo stage it had taken 
onto itself the religious element, which became 
the vital force that carried it from the defiles 
and wilds of Kwangsi province in the southwest 
to the city of Nanking in the northeast, and 

made it for a period of fifteen years a constantly

impending danger to the Mancfau Dynasty, 
whose corruption, weakness and maladministra- 
tion were the main causes that evoked the 
existence of this great rebellion. 

The religious element that gave it life and 
character was a foreign product, introduced into 
China hy the early Protestant missionaries, of 
whom Dr. Robert Morrison was the first Eng- 
lish pioneer sent out by the London Mission, 
followed a decade later by the Rev. Icabod J. 
Roberts, an American missionary. These two 
missionaries may properly claim the credit, if 
there is any, of having contributed (each in his 
particular sphere) in imparting to Hung Siu 
Chune a knowledge of Christianity. Dr. Morri- 
son, on his part, had translated the Bible into 
Chinese, and the Emperor Khang Hsi's dic- 
tionary into English; both these achievements 
gave the missionary work in China a basis to go 
upon in prosecuting the work of revising and of 
bringing the Bible to the Chinese standard of 
literary taste, so as to commend it to the literary 
classes, and in making further improvements in 
perfecting the Chinese-English dictionary, which 
was subsequently done by such men as Dr. Med- 
hurst, Bishop Boone, Dr. Legge, E. C. Bridge- 
man, and S. Wells Williams.

Besides these works of translation, which un- 
doubtedly called for further revision and im- 
provement, Dr. Morrison also gave China a 
native convert Leang Ahfah who became 
afterwards a noted preacher and the author of 
some religious tracts. 

Hung Siu Chune, in his quest after religious 
knowledge and truths, got hold of a copy of Dr. 
Morrison's Bible and the tracts of Leang Ahfah, 
He read and studied them, but he stood in need 
of a teacher to explain to him many points in 
the Bible, which appeared to him mysterious and 
obscure. He finally made the acquaintance of 
the Rev. Mr. Icabod J. Roberts, an American 
missionary from Missouri, who happened to 
make his headquarters in Canton. Hung Siu 
Chune called upon him often, till their acquaint- 
ance ripened into a close and lasting friendship, 
which was kept up till Hung Siu Chune suc- 
ceeded in taking Nanking, when Mr. Roberts 
was invited to reside there in the double capacity 
of a religious teacher and a state adviser. This 
was undoubtedly done in recognition of Mr. 
Roberts' services as Hung's teacher and friend 
while in Canton. No one knew what had become 
of Mr. Roberts when Nanking fell and reverted 
to the imperialists in 1864.

It was about this time, when he was sedulously 
seeking Mr. Roberts 5 religious instructions at 
Canton, that Hung failed to pass his first com- 
petitive examination as a candidate to compete 
for official appointment, and he decided to 
devote himself exclusively to the work of preach- 
ing the Gospel to his own people, the Hakkas 
of Kwang Tung and KwangsL But as a col- 
porter and native preacher, Hung had not 
reached the climax of his religious experience 
before taking up his stand as the leader of his 
people in open rebellion against the Manchu 
Dynasty. 

We must go back to the time when, as a 
candidate for the literary competitive examina- 
tions, he was disappointed. This threw him into 
a fever, and when he was tossing about in delir- 
ium, he was supposed to have been translated to 
Heaven, where he was commanded by the 
Almighty to fill and execute the divine mission 
of his life, which was to destroy idolatry, to 
rectify all wrong, to teach the people a knowledge 
of the true God, and to preach redemption 
through Christ. In view of such a mission, and 
being called to the presence of God, he at once 
assumed himself to be the son of God, co-equal 
with Christ, whom he called his elder brother. 



REFLECTIONS ON TAIPING REBELLION 117 

It was in such a state of mental hallucination 
that Hung Siu Chune appeared before his little 
congregation of Hakkas migrating strangers 
in the defiles and wilds of KwangsL Their 
novel and strange conduct as worshippers of 
Shangti the Supreme Ruler their daily reli- 
gious exercises, their prayers, and their chanting 
of the doxology as taught and enjoined by him, 
had attracted a widespread attention throughout 
all the surrounding region of KwangsL Every 
day fresh accessions of new comers flocked to 
their fold and swelled their ranks, till their 
numerical force grew so that the local mandarins 
were baffled and at their wits* end to know 
what to do with these believers of Christianity. 
Such, in brief, was the origin, growth and char- 
acter of the Christian element working among 
the simple and rustic mountaineers of Kwangsi 
and Kwang Tung. 

It is true that their knowledge of Christianity, 
as sifted through the medium of the early mis- 
sionaries from the West, and the native con- 
verts and colporters, was at best crude and 
elementary, but still they were truths of great 
power, potential enough to turn simple men and 
religiously-inclined women into heroes and 
heroines who faced dangers and death with the 



118 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

utmost indifference, as was seen subsequently, 
when the government had decided to take the 
bull by the horns and resorted to persecution as 
the final means to break up this religious, fanati- 
cal community. In their conflicts with the 
imperial forces, they had neither guns nor 
ammunition, but fought with broomsticks, flails 
and pitchforks. With these rustic and farming 
implements they drove the imperialist hordes 
before them as chaff and stubble before a 
hurricane. Such was their pent-up religious 
enthusiasm and burning ardor. 

Now this religious persecution was the side 
issue that had changed the resistance of Hung 
Siu Chime and his followers, in their religious 
capacity, into the character of a political 
rebellion. It is difficult to say whether or 
not, if persecution had not been resorted to, 
Hung Siu Chune and his followers would have 
remained peaceably in the heart of China and 
developed a religious community. We are in- 
clined to think, however, that even if there had 
been no persecution, a rebellion would have 
taken place, from the very nature of the political 
situation. 

Neither Christianity nor religious persecution 
was the immediate and logical cause of the 



REFLECTIONS OX TAIPING REBELLION 119 

rebellion of 1850. They might be taken as 
incidents or occasions that brought it about, but 
they were not the real causes of its existence. 
These may be found deeply seated in the vitals 
of the political constitution of the government. 
Foremost among them was the corruption of the 
the administrative government. The whole 
official organization, from head to foot, was 
honeycombed and tainted by a system of bribery, 
which passed under the polite and generic term 
of "presents," similar in character to what is now 
known as "graft." Next comes the exploitation 
of the people by the officials, who found an 
inexhaustible field to build up their fortunes. 
Finally comes the inevitable and logical corollary 
to official bribery and exploitation, namely, that 
the whole administrative government was found- 
ed on a gigantic system of fraud and falsehood. 

This rebellion rose in the arena of China 
with an enigmatic character like that of the 
Sphinx, somewhat puzzling at the start. The 
Christian world throughout the whole West, on 
learning of its Christian tendencies, such as the 
worship of the true and living God; Christ the 
Savior of the world; the Holy Spirit, the purifier 
of the soul; the destruction of temples and idols 
that was found wherever their victorious arms 



120 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

carried them; the uncompromising prohibition 
of th t e opium habit; the observance of a 
Sabbath; the offering of prayers before and 
after meals; the invocation of divine aid 
before a battle all these cardinal points 
of a Christian faith created a world-wide 
impression that China, through the instru- 
mentality of the Taipings, was to be evan- 
gelized; that the Manchu Dynasty was to be 
swept out of existence, and a "Celestial Empire 
of Universal Peace," as it was named by Hung 
Siu Chune, was going to be established, and thus 
China, by this wonderful intervention of a wise 
Providence, would be brought within the pale 
of Christian nations. But Christendom was a 
little too credulous and impulsive in the belief. 
It did not stop to have the Christianity of the 
Taipings pass through the crucible of a search- 
ing analysis. 

Their first victory over their persecutors 
undoubtedly gave Hung Siu Chune and his 
associates the first intimation of a possible over- 
turning of the Manchu Dynasty and the estab- 
lishment of a new one, which he named in 
his religious ecstasy "The Celestial Empire 
of Universal Peace." To the accomplishment of 
this great object, they bent the full force of 



REFLECTIONS ON TAIPING REBELLION 121 

their iconoclastic enthusiasm and religious zeal 
En route from Kwang Si, their starting point, 
to Nanking, victory had perched on their stan- 
dard all the way. They had despatched a division 
of their army to Peking, and, on its way to the 
northern capitol, it had met with a repulse and 
defeat at Tientsin from whence they had turned 
back to Nanking. In their victorious march 
through Hunan, Hupeh, Kiang Si and part of 
An Hwui, their depleted forces were replenished 
and reinforced by fresh and new accessions gath- 
ered from the people of those provinces. They 
were the riffraff and scum of their populations. 
This rabble element added no new strength to 
their fighting force, but proved to be an encum- 
brance and caused decided weakness. They knew 
no discipline, and had no restraining religious 
power to keep them from pillage, plunder and 
indiscriminate destruction. It was through such 
new accessions that the Taiping cause lost its 
prestige, and was defeated before Tientsin and 
forced to retreat to Nanking, After their defeat 
in the North, they began to decline in their 
religious character and their bravery. Their 
degeneracy was accelerated by the capture of 
Yang Chow, Suchau, and Hangchau, cities 
noted in Chinese history for their great wealth

as well as for their beautiful women. The cap- 
ture of these centers of a materialistic civilization 
poured into their laps untold wealth and luxury 
which tended to hasten their downfall. 

The Taiping Rebellion, after fifteen years of 
incessant and desultory fighting, collapsed and 
passed into oblivion, without leaving any traces of 
its career worthy of historical commemoration 
beyond the fact that it was the outburst of a 
religious fanaticism which held the Christian 
world in doubt and bewilderment, by reason of 
its Christian origin. It left no trace of its 
Christian element behind either in Nanking, 
where it sojourned for nearly ten years, or in 
Kwang Si, where it had its birth. In China, 
neither new political ideas nor political theories 
or principles were discovered which would have 
constituted the basal facts of a new form of 
government. So that neither in the religious nor 
yet in the political world was mankind in China 
or out of China benefited by that movement. 
The only good that resulted from the Taiping 
Rebellion was that God made use of it as a dy- 
namic power to break up the stagnancy of a great 
nation and wake up its consciousness for a new 
national life, as subsequent events in 1894, 1895, 
1898, 1900, 1901, and 1904-5 fully demonstrated.
