CHAPTER XI 

REFLECTIONS ON THE TAIPING 
REBELLION 

Rebellions and revolutions in China are not 
new and rare historic occurrences. There have 
been at least twenty-four dynasties and as many 
attendant rebellions or revolutions. But with 
the exception of the Feudatory period, revolu- 
tions in China (since the consolidation of the 
three Kingdoms into one Empire under the 
Emperor Chin) meant only a change of hands 
in the government, without a change either of 
its form, or principles. Hence the history of 
China for at least two thousand years, like her 
civilization, bears the national impress of a 
monotonous dead level jejune in character, 
wanting in versatility of genius, and almost 
devoid of historic inspiration. 

The Taiping Rebellion differs from its pre- 
decessors in that in its embryo stage it had taken 
onto itself the religious element, which became 
the vital force that carried it from the defiles 
and wilds of Kwangsi province in the southwest 
to the city of Nanking in the northeast, and 
made it for a period of fifteen years a constantly 
impending danger to the Mancfau Dynasty, 
whose corruption, weakness and maladministration 
were the main causes that evoked the 
existence of this great rebellion. 

The religious element that gave it life and 
character was a foreign product, introduced into 
China hy the early Protestant missionaries, of 
whom Dr. Robert Morrison was the first Eng- 
lish pioneer sent out by the London Mission, 
followed a decade later by the Rev. Icabod J. 
Roberts, an American missionary. These two 
missionaries may properly claim the credit, if 
there is any, of having contributed (each in his 
particular sphere) in imparting to Hung Siu 
Chune a knowledge of Christianity. Dr. Morri- 
son, on his part, had translated the Bible into 
Chinese, and the Emperor Khang Hsi's dic- 
tionary into English; both these achievements 
gave the missionary work in China a basis to go 
upon in prosecuting the work of revising and of 
bringing the Bible to the Chinese standard of 
literary taste, so as to commend it to the literary 
classes, and in making further improvements in 
perfecting the Chinese-English dictionary, which 
was subsequently done by such men as Dr. Med- 
hurst, Bishop Boone, Dr. Legge, E. C. Bridge- 
man, and S. Wells Williams. 

Besides these works of translation, which un- 
doubtedly called for further revision and im- 
provement, Dr. Morrison also gave China a 
native convert Leang Ahfah who became 
afterwards a noted preacher and the author of 
some religious tracts. 

Hung Siu Chune, in his quest after religious 
knowledge and truths, got hold of a copy of Dr. 
Morrison's Bible and the tracts of Leang Ahfah, 
He read and studied them, but he stood in need 
of a teacher to explain to him many points in 
the Bible, which appeared to him mysterious and 
obscure. He finally made the acquaintance of 
the Rev. Mr. Icabod J. Roberts, an American 
missionary from Missouri, who happened to 
make his headquarters in Canton. Hung Siu 
Chune called upon him often, till their acquaint- 
ance ripened into a close and lasting friendship, 
which was kept up till Hung Siu Chune suc- 
ceeded in taking Nanking, when Mr. Roberts 
was invited to reside there in the double capacity 
of a religious teacher and a state adviser. This 
was undoubtedly done in recognition of Mr. 
Roberts' services as Hung's teacher and friend 
while in Canton. No one knew what had become 
of Mr. Roberts when Nanking fell and reverted 
to the imperialists in 1864. 

It was about this time, when he was sedulously 
seeking Mr. Roberts 5 religious instructions at 
Canton, that Hung failed to pass his first com- 
petitive examination as a candidate to compete 
for official appointment, and he decided to 
devote himself exclusively to the work of preach- 
ing the Gospel to his own people, the Hakkas 
of Kwang Tung and KwangsL But as a col- 
porter and native preacher, Hung had not 
reached the climax of his religious experience 
before taking up his stand as the leader of his 
people in open rebellion against the Manchu 
Dynasty. 

We must go back to the time when, as a 
candidate for the literary competitive examina- 
tions, he was disappointed. This threw him into 
a fever, and when he was tossing about in delir- 
ium, he was supposed to have been translated to 
Heaven, where he was commanded by the 
Almighty to fill and execute the divine mission 
of his life, which was to destroy idolatry, to 
rectify all wrong, to teach the people a knowledge 
of the true God, and to preach redemption 
through Christ. In view of such a mission, and 
being called to the presence of God, he at once 
assumed himself to be the son of God, co-equal 
with Christ, whom he called his elder brother. 

It was in such a state of mental hallucination 
that Hung Siu Chune appeared before his little 
congregation of Hakkas migrating strangers 
in the defiles and wilds of KwangsL Their 
novel and strange conduct as worshippers of 
Shangti the Supreme Ruler their daily reli- 
gious exercises, their prayers, and their chanting 
of the doxology as taught and enjoined by him, 
had attracted a widespread attention throughout 
all the surrounding region of KwangsL Every 
day fresh accessions of new comers flocked to 
their fold and swelled their ranks, till their 
numerical force grew so that the local mandarins 
were baffled and at their wits* end to know 
what to do with these believers of Christianity. 
Such, in brief, was the origin, growth and char- 
acter of the Christian element working among 
the simple and rustic mountaineers of Kwangsi 
and Kwang Tung. 

It is true that their knowledge of Christianity, 
as sifted through the medium of the early mis- 
sionaries from the West, and the native con- 
verts and colporters, was at best crude and 
elementary, but still they were truths of great 
power, potential enough to turn simple men and 
religiously-inclined women into heroes and 
heroines who faced dangers and death with the 
utmost indifference, as was seen subsequently, 
when the government had decided to take the 
bull by the horns and resorted to persecution as 
the final means to break up this religious, fanati- 
cal community. In their conflicts with the 
imperial forces, they had neither guns nor 
ammunition, but fought with broomsticks, flails 
and pitchforks. With these rustic and farming 
implements they drove the imperialist hordes 
before them as chaff and stubble before a 
hurricane. Such was their pent-up religious 
enthusiasm and burning ardor. 

Now this religious persecution was the side 
issue that had changed the resistance of Hung 
Siu Chime and his followers, in their religious 
capacity, into the character of a political 
rebellion. It is difficult to say whether or 
not, if persecution had not been resorted to, 
Hung Siu Chune and his followers would have 
remained peaceably in the heart of China and 
developed a religious community. We are in- 
clined to think, however, that even if there had 
been no persecution, a rebellion would have 
taken place, from the very nature of the political 
situation. 

Neither Christianity nor religious persecution 
was the immediate and logical cause of the 
rebellion of 1850. They might be taken as 
incidents or occasions that brought it about, but 
they were not the real causes of its existence. 
These may be found deeply seated in the vitals 
of the political constitution of the government. 
Foremost among them was the corruption of the 
the administrative government. The whole 
official organization, from head to foot, was 
honeycombed and tainted by a system of bribery, 
which passed under the polite and generic term 
of "presents," similar in character to what is now 
known as "graft." Next comes the exploitation 
of the people by the officials, who found an 
inexhaustible field to build up their fortunes. 
Finally comes the inevitable and logical corollary 
to official bribery and exploitation, namely, that 
the whole administrative government was found- 
ed on a gigantic system of fraud and falsehood. 

This rebellion rose in the arena of China 
with an enigmatic character like that of the 
Sphinx, somewhat puzzling at the start. The 
Christian world throughout the whole West, on 
learning of its Christian tendencies, such as the 
worship of the true and living God; Christ the 
Savior of the world; the Holy Spirit, the purifier 
of the soul; the destruction of temples and idols 
that was found wherever their victorious arms 
carried them; the uncompromising prohibition 
of th t e opium habit; the observance of a 
Sabbath; the offering of prayers before and 
after meals; the invocation of divine aid 
before a battle all these cardinal points 
of a Christian faith created a world-wide 
impression that China, through the instru- 
mentality of the Taipings, was to be evan- 
gelized; that the Manchu Dynasty was to be 
swept out of existence, and a "Celestial Empire 
of Universal Peace," as it was named by Hung 
Siu Chune, was going to be established, and thus 
China, by this wonderful intervention of a wise 
Providence, would be brought within the pale 
of Christian nations. But Christendom was a 
little too credulous and impulsive in the belief. 
It did not stop to have the Christianity of the 
Taipings pass through the crucible of a search- 
ing analysis. 

Their first victory over their persecutors 
undoubtedly gave Hung Siu Chune and his 
associates the first intimation of a possible over- 
turning of the Manchu Dynasty and the estab- 
lishment of a new one, which he named in 
his religious ecstasy "The Celestial Empire 
of Universal Peace." To the accomplishment of 
this great object, they bent the full force of 
their iconoclastic enthusiasm and religious zeal 
En route from Kwang Si, their starting point, 
to Nanking, victory had perched on their stan- 
dard all the way. They had despatched a division 
of their army to Peking, and, on its way to the 
northern capitol, it had met with a repulse and 
defeat at Tientsin from whence they had turned 
back to Nanking. In their victorious march 
through Hunan, Hupeh, Kiang Si and part of 
An Hwui, their depleted forces were replenished 
and reinforced by fresh and new accessions gath- 
ered from the people of those provinces. They 
were the riffraff and scum of their populations. 
This rabble element added no new strength to 
their fighting force, but proved to be an encum- 
brance and caused decided weakness. They knew 
no discipline, and had no restraining religious 
power to keep them from pillage, plunder and 
indiscriminate destruction. It was through such 
new accessions that the Taiping cause lost its 
prestige, and was defeated before Tientsin and 
forced to retreat to Nanking, After their defeat 
in the North, they began to decline in their 
religious character and their bravery. Their 
degeneracy was accelerated by the capture of 
Yang Chow, Suchau, and Hangchau, cities 
noted in Chinese history for their great wealth 
as well as for their beautiful women. The cap- 
ture of these centers of a materialistic civilization 
poured into their laps untold wealth and luxury 
which tended to hasten their downfall. 

The Taiping Rebellion, after fifteen years of 
incessant and desultory fighting, collapsed and 
passed into oblivion, without leaving any traces of 
its career worthy of historical commemoration 
beyond the fact that it was the outburst of a 
religious fanaticism which held the Christian 
world in doubt and bewilderment, by reason of 
its Christian origin. It left no trace of its 
Christian element behind either in Nanking, 
where it sojourned for nearly ten years, or in 
Kwang Si, where it had its birth. In China, 
neither new political ideas nor political theories 
or principles were discovered which would have 
constituted the basal facts of a new form of 
government. So that neither in the religious nor 
yet in the political world was mankind in China 
or out of China benefited by that movement. 
The only good that resulted from the Taiping 
Rebellion was that God made use of it as a dy- 
namic power to break up the stagnancy of a great 
nation and wake up its consciousness for a new 
national life, as subsequent events in 1894, 1895, 
1898, 1900, 1901, and 1904-5 fully demonstrated. 


第十一章
太平天国之反思

中国的叛乱与革命，并非罕见的历史偶发事件。自古以来已有至少二十四个王朝，而伴随其兴衰的，也不乏同样多次的叛乱或革命。然而，自三国统一于秦始皇之手之后，除了封建割据时期之外，中国的历次革命，几乎只是政权的更替，并未触及其政体或基本原则的改变。因此，中国两千年的历史，如其文明一般，打上了民族性的一成不变的印记，单调贫乏，缺乏才智的多样性，几乎完全没有历史灵感可言。

太平天国与以往历次起义不同，它在胚胎阶段便孕育了一种宗教元素，这正是其生命力之源，驱使它由西南广西的山谷荒野一路推进至东北的南京，并使之成为持续十五年之久、对满清王朝构成严重威胁的隐患。而这个王朝的腐败、软弱与失政，正是这场大叛乱爆发的主要原因。

赋予太平天国生命与特质的宗教因素，来自西方，由最早期的基督教新教传教士传入中国，首位是由伦敦差会派遣的英国传教士马礼逊博士，其后十年，美国密苏里州的伊卡伯·罗伯茨牧师亦随之而来。若要追溯洪秀全如何接触基督教，马礼逊与罗伯茨这两位传教士确有一份功劳，各自在其领域播下种子。马礼逊博士将《圣经》译为中文，并将康熙字典译为英文，这两项成就为圣经在中国的传播提供了基础，后人如美德爵士、文惠廉主教、理雅各、裨治文与卫三畏等，进一步将圣经文体修订至更合中文士人之审美，并改进中英词典之质量。

除翻译工作之外，马礼逊还培养了一位重要的华人信徒梁阿发，他后来成为著名的布道家，亦撰写了若干宗教小册子。

洪秀全在寻求宗教真理的过程中，读到了马礼逊翻译的圣经及梁阿发的文字。他研读这些著作，但由于其中多有他难以理解的神秘与晦涩之处，遂渴望有一位老师指引他。最终，他认识了来自密苏里、时驻广州的美国传教士罗伯茨牧师。洪秀全频繁拜访，二人关系日益密切，最终建立了深厚持久的友谊。直至洪秀全攻下南京后，邀请罗伯茨以宗教导师与国政顾问的双重身份入驻。此举无疑是对他在广州时作为老师与友人的致敬。至于南京在1864年沦陷后，罗伯茨的下落则不为人知。

大约在洪秀全热切向罗伯茨求教的时期，他首次参加科举考试落第，由此心灰意冷，决定弃仕从道，专心向其同乡粤、桂两省的客家人传讲福音。然而在成为布道者与圣书推销员的阶段，他尚未完成其宗教经验的极致，便已挺身而出，领导其族人公然反抗满清政权。

我们得回溯至他初次落第之时。此事令他精神错乱，卧病高烧，妄想之中据说升天，被天父赋予神圣使命，要他破除偶像崇拜，匡正世间邪恶，引导人民认识真神，传扬基督救赎之道。既得此天命，又被召见于上帝面前，洪秀全便自认是上帝之子，与基督同等，并称基督为其兄。

正是在此种精神错乱的状态下，洪秀全出现在广西偏僻山谷中一群流动迁徙的客家信徒面前。他们每日向“上帝”敬拜，举行宗教仪式、祷告、唱诗，种种新奇而奇特的行为，在广西一带引起轰动。每日皆有新人加入，信众激增，当地官员束手无策，不知如何应对这群基督徒。简言之，这便是太平天国在广西、广东山区民众中，基督宗教元素萌发、发展与传播的始末。

诚然，他们对基督教的理解，经由西方早期传教士、华人信徒及书贩之传播，颇为粗浅与原始，但其中仍蕴含着强大力量，足以使平凡之人、虔诚之妇成为视死如归的英雄与女烈。尤其当清政府决定以强硬手段镇压这个狂热宗教团体时，这种精神尤为突出。他们面对官军时，无枪无弹，仅以扫帚、连枷、干草叉作武器，竟能击溃如潮的清军，如狂风吹散枯叶。这正是他们那燃烧的宗教热忱与信仰激情的写照。

而正是这种宗教迫害，将洪秀全及其追随者原本的宗教性质之抗争，演变为政治叛乱。很难说，若无清政府的打压，洪氏是否仍会走上起义之路，抑或能在内地建立一个和平的宗教社群。但就当时的政治现实而言，即使没有迫害，叛乱或许终归难以避免。

基督教本身，或清政府对其的镇压，并非1850年太平天国起义的直接与根本原因。它们最多只能视作诱因或导火索，真正的根源则深植于当时政治体制的病灶之中。

其一，是政府全面腐败。整个官僚体系自上而下，皆沉溺于贿赂之中，表面称为“馈赠”，实则是类似今日所称的“贪污”。
其二，是官员对百姓的压榨，视其为聚敛财富的无尽矿藏。
其三，是上述二者之必然结果：整个行政体系，根植于一个庞大的欺诈与虚伪之系统中。

这场叛乱在中国政局中以一种如斯芬克斯般神秘莫测之姿登场，令人起初困惑不解。西方基督教世界得知其信仰上帝、敬奉救世主基督、依靠圣灵净化心灵、所到之处破坏庙宇与偶像、严格禁烟、守安息日、餐前餐后祈祷、战前呼求神助等种种教义行为时，顿生希望，以为太平军将使中国归入基督教国家之列，扫除满清，建立一个“万国安和天朝”，洪秀全曾如此命名其政权。然而，西方基督徒对此过于轻信与感情用事，未曾将太平天国之基督信仰放入深度分析之炉中锤炼。

他们初次击退官军，给予洪秀全及其伙伴以巨大信心，认为有可能推翻满清，建立以“万国安和天朝”为名的新王朝。他们遂以全部热忱与信仰狂热投入此理想之实现。从广西起义出发，至南京一路高奏凯歌。曾派军北上进攻北京，惜在天津受挫，折返南京。在其横扫湖南、湖北、江西与安徽部分地区之过程中，又吸收了大量新兵，但这些新兵多为地痞无赖，对军力无实益，反而成为拖累。他们缺乏纪律，更无宗教力量之约束，纵情劫掠焚掠，导致太平军名声受损，天津败北后回返南京，宗教精神与士气亦由此开始衰退。

更有甚者，他们攻陷扬州、苏州与杭州，这些城市历来以财富与美女闻名，带来的奢华与享乐，使太平军沉溺其中，加速了其堕落。

太平天国经过十五年漫长而零碎的战斗，最终土崩瓦解，湮没无闻。除了其宗教狂热的起源曾使基督教世界迷惑外，其余再无值得史家铭记者。它在南京盘踞近十年，在广西发源，然而无一地留下其基督教的遗产。中国亦未由此运动激发任何新政治理念、理论或制度，故无论宗教或政治方面，中国与世界皆未得益。

唯一可言之“善果”的，是上帝借太平之力，冲击了一个沉寂太久的大国，使其重新唤醒民族意识，其后在1894、1895、1898、1900、1901、以及1904至1905年的一系列变革与事件中，已可见其深远影响。
