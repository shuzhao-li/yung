CHAPTER XVI 

PROPOSAL OF MY EDUCATIONAL 
SCHEME 

Having scored in a small way this educa- 
tional victory, by inducing the Viceroy to estab- 
lish a mechanical training school as a corollary 
to the arsenal, I felt quite worked up and encour- 
aged concerning my educational scheme which 
had been lying dormant in my mind for the past 
fifteen years, awaiting an opportunity to be 
brought forward. 

Besides Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, whom I 
counted upon to back me in furthering the 
scheme, Ting Yih Chang, an old friend of mine, 
had become an important factor to be reckoned 
with in Chinese politics. He was a man of pro- 
gressive tendencies and was alive to all practical 
measures of reform. He had been appointed 
governor of Kiangsu province, and after his 
accession to his new office, I had many inter- 
views with him regarding my educational scheme, 
in which he was intensely interested. He told 
me that he was in correspondence with Wen 
Seang, the prime minister of China, who was a 
Manchu, and that if I were to put my scheme in 
writing, he would forward it to Peking, and ask 
Wen Seang to use his influence to memorialize 
the government for its adoption. Such an unex- 
pected piece of information came like a clap of 
thunder and fairly lifted me off my feet. I im- 
mediately left Suchau for Shanghai. With the 
help of my Nanking friend, who had helped me 
in the work of translating "Parsons on Con- 
tracts," I drew up four proposals to be present- 
ed to Governor Ting, to be forwarded by him to 
Minister Wen Seang, at Peking. They were as 
follows : 

FIRST PROPOSAL 

The first proposal contemplated the organiza- 
tion of a Steamship Company on a joint stock 
basis. No foreigner was to be allowed to be a 
stockholder in the company. It was to be a 
purely Chinese company, managed and worked 
by Chinese exclusively. 

To insure its stability and success, an annual 
government subsidy was to be made in the shape 
of a certain percentage of the tribute rice 
carried to Peking from Shanghai and Chinkiang, 
and elsewhere, where tribute rice is paid over to 
the government in lieu of taxes in money. This 
tribute rice heretofore had been taken to Peking 
by flat-bottom boats, via the Grand Canal. 
Thousands of these boats were built expressly 
for this rice transportation, which supported a 
large population all along the whole route of the 
Grand Canal. 

On account of the great evils arising from this 
mode of transportation, such as the great length 
of time it took to take the rice to Peking, the 
great percentage of loss from theft, and from 
fermentation, which made the rice unfit for food, 
part of the tribute rice was carried by sea in 
Ningpo junks as far as Tiensin, and from thence 
transhipped again in flat-bottom boats to Peking. 
But even the Ningpo junk system was attended 
with great loss of time and much damage, almost 
as great as by flat-bottom scows* My proposi- 
tion was to use steam to do the work, supplanting 
both the flat-bottomed scows and the Ningpo 
junk system, so that the millions who were de- 
pendent on rice for subsistence might find it 
possible to get good and sound rice. This is 
one of the great benefits and blessings which the 
China Merchant Steamship Co. has conferred 
upon China. 

SECOND PROPOSAL 

The second proposition was for the govern- 
ment to send picked Chinese youths abroad to be 
thoroughly educated for the public service. The 
scheme contemplated the education of one hun- 
dred and twenty students as an experiment. 
These one hundred and twenty students were to 
be divided into four installments of thirty 
students each, one installment to be sent out 
each year. They were to have fifteen years 
to finish their education. Their average age was 
to be from twelve to fourteen years. If the 
first and second installments proved to be a suc- 
cess, the scheme was to be continued indefinitely. 
Chinese teachers were to be provided to keep up 
their knowledge of Chinese while in the United 
States. Over the whole enterprise two commis- 
sioners were to be appointed, and the govern- 
ment was to appropriate a certain percentage of 
the Shanghai customs to maintain the mission. 

THIRD PROPOSAL 

The third proposition was to induce the gov- 
ernment to open the mineral resources of the 
country and thus in an indirect way lead to the 
necessity of introducing railroads to transport 
the mineral products from the interior to the 
ports. 

I did not expect this proposition to be adopted 
and carried out, because China at that time had 
no mining engineers who could be depended 
upon to develop the mines, nor were the people 
free from the Fung Shui superstition.* I had no 
faith whatever in the success of this proposition, 
but simply put it in writing to show how ambi- 
tious I was to have the government wake up to 
the possibilities of the development of its vast 
resources. 

*The doctrine held by the Chinese in relation to the spirits or 
genii that rule over winds and waters, especially running streams 
and subterranean waters. This doctrine is universal and inveterate 
among the Chinese, and in a great measure prompts their hostility 
to railroads and telegraphs, since they believe that such structures 
anger the spirits of the air and waters and consequently cause 
floods and typhoons. Standard Dictionary. 

FOURTH PROPOSAL 

The encroachment of foreign powers upon the 
independent sovereignty of China has always 
been watched by me with the most intense inter- 
est. No one who is at all acquainted with Roman 
Catholicism can fail to be impressed with the 
unwarranted pretensions and assumptions of the 
Romish church in China. She claims civil jurisdiction 
over her proselytes, and takes civil and 
criminal cases out of Chinese courts* In order to 
put a stop to such insidious and crafty workings 
to gain temporal power in China, I put forth 
this proposition: to prohibit missionaries of any 
religious sect or denomination from exercising 
any kind of jurisdiction over their converts, in 
either civil or criminal cases. These four propo- 
sitions were carefully drawn up, and were pre- 
sented to Governor Ting for transmission to 
Peking. 

Of the four proposals, the first, third and 
fourth were put in to chaperone the second, in 
which my whole heart was enlisted, and which 
above all others was the one I wanted to be taken 
up ; but not to give it too prominent a place, at the 
suggestion of my Chinese teacher, it was as- 
signed a second place in the order of the arrange- 
ment. Governor Ting recognized this, and ac- 
cordingly wrote to Prime Minister Wen Seang 
and forwarded the proposals to Peking. Two 
months later, a letter from Ting, at Suchau, his 
headquarters, gave me to understand that news 
from Peking had reached him that Wen Seang's 
mother had died, and he was obliged, according 
to Chinese laws and customs, to retire from office 
and go into mourning for a period of twenty- 
seven months, equivalent to three years, and to 
abstain altogether from public affairs of all 
kinds. This news threw a cold blanket over my 
educational scheme for the time being. No sooner 
had one misfortune happened than another took 
its place, worst than the first Wen Seang him- 
self, three months afterwards, was overtaken by 
death during his retirement. This announce- 
ment appeared in the Peking "Gazette," which I 
saw, besides being officially informed of it by 
Governor Ting. No one who had a pet scheme 
to promote or a hobby to ride could feel more 
blue than I did, when the cup of joy held so near 
to his lips was dashed from him. I was not entire- 
ly disheartened by such circumstances, but had an 
abiding faith that my educational scheme would 
in the end come out all right. There was an 
interval of at least three years of suspense and 
waiting between 1868 and 1870. I kept pegging 
at Governor Ting, urging him to keep the sub- 
ject constantly before Viceroy Tsang's mind. 
But like the fate of all measures of reform, it had 
to abide its time and opportunity. 

The time and the opportunity for my educational 
scheme to materialize finally came. 
Contrary to all human expectations, the opportunity 
appeared in the guise of the Tientsin Massacre. 
No more did Samson, when he slew the Tim- 
nath lion, expect to extract honey from its 
carcass than did I expect to extract from the 
slaughter of the French nuns and Sisters of 
Charity the educational scheme that was destined 
to make a new China of the old, and to work out 
an Oriental civilization on an Occidental basis. 

The Tientsin Massacre took place early in 
1870. It arose from the gross ignorance and 
superstition of the Tientsin populace regarding 
the work of the nuns and Sisters of Charity, part 
of whose religious duty it was to rescue found- 
lings and castaway orphans, who were gathered 
into hospitals, cared for and educated for the 
services of the Roman Catholic church. This 
beneficent work was misunderstood and miscon- 
strued by the ignorant masses, who really be- 
lieved in the rumors and stories that the infants 
and children thus gathered in were taken into 
the hospitals and churches to have their eyes 
gouged out for medical and religious purposes. 
Such diabolical reports soon spread like wild-fire 
till popular excitement was worked up to its 
highest pitch of frenzy, and the infuriated mob, 
regardless of death and fearless of law, plunged 
headlong into the Tientsin Massacre. In that 
massacre a Protestant church was burned and 
destroyed, as was also a Roman Catholic church 
and hospital; several nuns or Sisters of Charity 
were killed. 

At the time of this occurrence, Chung Hou 
was viceroy of the Metropolitan province. He 
had been ambassador to Russia previously, but 
in this unfortunate affair, according to Chinese 
law, he was held responsible, was degraded from 
office and banished. The whole imbroglio was 
finally settled and patched up by the payment of 
an indemnity to the relatives and friends of the 
victims of the massacre and the rebuilding of 
the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, 
another Catholic hospital, besides a suitable 
official apology made by the government for the 
incident. Had the French government not been 
handicapped by the impending German War 
which threatened her at the time, France would 
certainly have made the Tientsin Massacre a 
casus belli, and another slice of the Chinese 
Empire would have been annexed to the French 
possessions in Asia. As it was, Tonquin, a 
tributary state of China, was afterwards 
unscrupulously wrenched from her. 

In the settlement of the massacre, the Imperial 
commissioners appointed were: Viceroy Tsang 
Kwoh Fan, Mow Chung Hsi, Liu * * * and 
Ting Yih Chang, Governor of Kiang Su. Li 
Hung Chang was still in the field finishing up 
the Nienfi rebellion, otherwise he, too, would have 
been appointed to take part in the proceedings 
of the settlement. I was telegraphed for by my 
friend, Ting Yih Chang, to be present to act as 
interpreter on the occasion, but the telegram did 
not reach me in time for me to accompany him to 
Tientsin; but I reached Tientsin in time to wit- 
ness the last proceedings* The High Commis- 
sioners, after the settlement with the French, for 
some reason or other, did not disband, but re- 
mained in Tientsin for several days. They evi- 
dently had other matters of State connected with 
Chung Hou's degradation and banishment to 
consider.

我提出的教育方案

由于成功地说服总督设立一所机械培训学校，作为军火厂的附属机构，我算是小小地取得了一次教育上的胜利。这让我情绪高涨，备受鼓舞，决心推进我那已经在脑中沉睡十五年的教育方案，终于等来了一个可以提出的机会。

除了总督曾国藩（我一直寄望他支持我推进这项方案）外，我的一位老朋友丁日昌也在中国政坛上成为一个不可忽视的重要人物。他是一位具有进步思想的人，对一切实际可行的改革措施都非常关注。他当时被任命为江苏省巡抚，在他履新后，我与他多次会面，详细讨论我的教育方案，他对此表现出极大兴趣。他告诉我，他正在与满族的中国首辅文祥通信；如果我能将方案整理成文，他愿意呈送北京，并请求文祥出面上奏政府，争取采纳。

这个意外的消息如同晴天霹雳，让我欣喜若狂。我立刻离开苏州前往上海，并在曾协助我翻译《帕森斯合同法》的南京友人帮助下，起草了四项建议，准备提交给丁日昌，由他转呈北京的文祥大臣。四项建议如下：

第一项建议

第一项建议是组织一家蒸汽轮船公司，采取股份制方式经营。外国人不得持股，该公司完全由中国人出资、管理和运营。

为了保证公司的稳定和成功，政府每年应给予补贴，形式为拨出一定比例的漕粮运费。此类漕粮原本是从上海、镇江等地送往北京，用以代替货币缴税。这些年，漕粮一直是通过大运河由平底船运送。大批这类船专门为漕粮运输而建，养活了运河沿岸无数百姓。

但这种运输方式弊端重重，例如时间冗长，途中经常被盗，以及发酵变质，造成大量浪费。于是部分漕粮改用宁波大帆船绕海运至天津，再转由平底船入京。但即便如此，海路运输依然存在时间长、损耗大的问题，与内河运输相差无几。我的建议是全面改用蒸汽轮船，替代平底船与宁波帆船系统，让亿万依赖大米维生的中国百姓能够吃上新鲜、安全的大米。这也正是日后中国轮船招商局带给中国的一项重大福祉。

第二项建议

第二项建议是政府应挑选优秀少年，送往国外深造，为将来担任公职做准备。该方案拟定先送出一百二十名学生作为试点，分四年完成，每年送出三十人。这些学生将有十五年时间完成学业，年龄应在十二至十四岁之间。如前两批取得成功，此计划将长期推行。为保证学生在美国期间不忘本国文化，政府应配备中文教师，协助其维持中文水平。整个计划将由两位专员总管，政府并应从上海海关收入中划出一定比例的经费用以维持此项事业。

第三项建议

第三项建议是建议政府开发国内矿产资源，这样一来，便有引入铁路运输的需要，将矿产从内地运往港口。

我并不指望此项建议能被采纳，因为当时中国没有可靠的矿业工程师，也深受风水迷信所困。我对这项建议本身并无信心，写出来只是为了表达我对唤醒政府意识、开发国家巨大资源潜力的渴望。

注：“风水”是中国传统信仰，认为空气与水流中有神灵掌管，尤其是地下水与河流。此信仰普遍且根深蒂固，因而使得铁路与电报线路等现代设施广受抵制，民间认为这些工程激怒神灵，会带来水灾或台风。——引自《标准大辞典》

第四项建议

我始终高度关注外国势力侵犯中国主权的行径。熟悉天主教的人都会注意到，罗马教会在中国的种种非分要求与越权行为。她声称对教徒拥有司法权力，擅自将民事与刑事案件从中国法庭夺走。为了阻止这种狡猾的图谋，防止外国教会染指中国的世俗权力，我提出应明确禁止所有宗教教派的传教士对其信徒行使任何形式的司法权，无论是民事还是刑事案件。

这四项建议我都认真整理好，提交给丁日昌，由他转送北京。

这四项建议中，第一、第三和第四项只是用来“掩护”第二项；我对第二项倾注了全部心力，才是我真正想推进的方案。但为了不让它显得过于突出，我遵照我的中文教师的建议，将其安排在第二位。丁日昌对此心领神会，随即写信给文祥，并将四项建议送往北京。

两个月后，丁从苏州写信告诉我，他收到北京的消息，文祥的母亲去世了。依照中国的法律与习俗，文祥必须辞职守孝，长达二十七个月（即三年），在此期间不得过问政务。这一消息无疑给我的教育计划泼了一盆冷水。更不幸的是，不久后又传来噩耗：文祥本人在守孝期间病逝。我在看到北京《邸报》的讣告之外，也收到了丁日昌的正式通知。

当一个人对自己心爱的计划满怀希望时，成果即将到手之际却被打碎，那种沮丧难以言表。但我并没有完全失望，仍坚信我的教育方案终有一天会成功。

从1868年到1870年之间，我经历了三年的等待与悬念。我不断催促丁日昌，希望他能时常提醒曾国藩关注此事。但像所有改革措施一样，此事也必须等待时机的到来。

最终，这个机会以令人意想不到的方式出现——天津教案。正如参孙从所杀狮子的尸体中取出蜂蜜，我也未曾预料，从惨烈的天津教案中竟能催生出一个将重塑中国的教育计划，奠定东方文明以西方为基的新路径。

天津教案发生于1870年初，其根源在于天津百姓对慈善修女的工作怀有极大误解。修女们负责收养弃婴与孤儿，在教会医院照顾他们并将其培养为天主教服务人员。然而，这些慈善行为被愚昧大众误解，竟相信那些孩子被带入教堂是为了被挖眼用于医疗或宗教目的。这种荒诞的谣言迅速蔓延，煽动民众情绪至极点，最终导致群情激愤，法律无效，一场屠杀爆发。

在这场教案中，一所新教教堂与天主教教堂及其附属医院均被焚毁，数位修女丧命。

当时直隶总督为崇厚，他曾任驻俄大使。根据中国法律，他对教案负有责任，随即被革职流放。事件最终通过赔偿受害者家属、重建新教与天主教教堂及医院，并由政府正式道歉才得以了结。若非法国当时正因德法战争迫在眉睫而分身乏术，法国极有可能以此为借口对华开战，进而侵占更多中国领土。尽管如此，中国后来还是失去了附属国——东京（越南北部）。

此次事件的清廷代表为：曾国藩、毛鸿宾、刘某某、江苏巡抚丁日昌。李鸿章因尚在平定捻军，未能参加此行。

我收到丁日昌发来的电报，邀请我作为翻译参加天津事务，但电报传递延误，未能与他同行。我虽未赶上开头，却赶上了最后的收尾阶段。诸位钦差在与法国达成协议后，并未立即解散，而是继续滞留天津，显然还有关于崇厚被贬与后续政务需商议。

第十六章
教育计划之提案

此番促成江南制造局附设机械学堂，虽仅小试牛刀，却令我蛰伏十五载的教育宏图重焕生机。除却曾国藩这位有力后盾，老友丁日昌此时已跻身政坛要津。这位开明布政使对改革实务颇具热忱，履新江苏巡抚后，我屡次与之商讨教育计划，深得其赏识。他透露正与总理衙门大臣文祥书信往来，若我能将计划形诸文字，便可转呈北京请其斡旋。此讯如惊雷贯耳，令我振奋不已。

我当即返沪，在昔日合译《契约论》的南京文士协助下，拟定四条陈请：

首议轮船招商
倡设纯华资股份制轮船公司，严禁洋人入股。请以漕粮运输补贴维系——原由平底漕船经大运河输京的税粮，因耗时耗损严重（霉变失窃常达三成），部分改由宁波沙船海运至津再转漕船。新法拟全以蒸汽船替代，既利国计民生，亦为日后招商局之雏形。

次议幼童留洋
此实为我心血所系。请选派百二十名十二至十四岁幼童，分四批赴美留学，以十五年为期。留美期间专设汉文教习，岁拨江海关关税若干为经费。首二批若见成效，则永续施行。

三议矿务开发
明知当时中国既乏矿师，民间又笃信风水，开矿筑路之议难成，仍列此条以启实业之思。

四议教权约束
针对天主教会擅夺教民诉讼管辖权之积弊，请严禁各派教士干预词讼。

经幕僚指点，将教育提案置于次席以避锋芒。丁抚识破深意，专函致文祥转呈。讵料两月后噩耗接连：文祥丁忧去职，未几竟溘然长逝。1868至1870年间，我屡向丁抚进言，请其向曾督进谏，然改革之事终须待时。

转机竟以最吊诡的方式降临——1870年天津教案爆发。愚民误信天主堂挖眼制药谣言，焚毁教堂医院，戕害修女多人。清廷派曾国藩、毛昶熙等查办，丁抚亦奉调会办。我接电召赴津任通译，虽未及同行，终得见证议结尾声。

法德战云密布使法国无暇东顾，赔款建堂、惩办官员了结此案。而留美教育计划，恰似参孙从死狮取蜜般，竟自这场血案中获得重生之机。教案善后，诸大臣滞留津门未散，我之教育大计，终将在这特殊时刻迎来转圜。
