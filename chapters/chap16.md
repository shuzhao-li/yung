CHAPTER XVI 

PROPOSAL OF MY EDUCATIONAL 
SCHEME 

Having scored in a small way this educa- 
tional victory, by inducing the Viceroy to estab- 
lish a mechanical training school as a corollary 
to the arsenal, I felt quite worked up and encour- 
aged concerning my educational scheme which 
had been lying dormant in my mind for the past 
fifteen years, awaiting an opportunity to be 
brought forward. 

Besides Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan, whom I 
counted upon to back me in furthering the 
scheme, Ting Yih Chang, an old friend of mine, 
had become an important factor to be reckoned 
with in Chinese politics. He was a man of pro- 
gressive tendencies and was alive to all practical 
measures of reform. He had been appointed 
governor of Kiangsu province, and after his 
accession to his new office, I had many inter- 
views with him regarding my educational scheme, 
in which he was intensely interested. He told 

me that he was in correspondence with Wen

MY EDUCATIONAL SCHEME 171 

Seang, the prime minister of China, who was a 
Manchu, and that if I were to put my scheme in 
writing, he would forward it to Peking, and ask 
Wen Seang to use his influence to memorialize 
the government for its adoption. Such an unex- 
pected piece of information came like a clap of 
thunder and fairly lifted me off my feet. I im- 
mediately left Suchau for Shanghai. With the 
help of my Nanking friend, who had helped me 
in the work of translating "Parsons on Con- 
tracts," I drew up four proposals to be present- 
ed to Governor Ting, to be forwarded by him to 
Minister Wen Seang, at Peking. They were as 
follows : 

FIRST PROPOSAL 

The first proposal contemplated the organiza- 
tion of a Steamship Company on a joint stock 
basis. No foreigner was to be allowed to be a 
stockholder in the company. It was to be a 
purely Chinese company, managed and worked 
by Chinese exclusively. 

To insure its stability and success, an annual 
government subsidy was to be made in the shape 
of a certain percentage of the tribute rice 
carried to Peking from Shanghai and Chinkiang, 



172 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and elsewhere, where tribute rice is paid over to 
the government in lieu of taxes in money. This 
tribute rice heretofore had been taken to Peking 
by flat-bottom boats, via the Grand Canal. 
Thousands of these boats were built expressly 
for this rice transportation, which supported a 
large population all along the whole route of the 
Grand Canal. 

On account of the great evils arising from this 
mode of transportation, such as the great length 
of time it took to take the rice to Peking, the 
great percentage of loss from theft, and from 
fermentation, which made the rice unfit for food, 
part of the tribute rice was carried by sea in 
Ningpo junks as far as Tiensin, and from thence 
transhipped again in flat-bottom boats to Peking. 
But even the Ningpo junk system was attended 
with great loss of time and much damage, almost 
as great as by flat-bottom scows* My proposi- 
tion was to use steam to do the work, supplanting 
both the flat-bottomed scows and the Ningpo 
junk system, so that the millions who were de- 
pendent on rice for subsistence might find it 
possible to get good and sound rice. This is 
one of the great benefits and blessings which the 
China Merchant Steamship Co. has conferred 
upon China. 



SECOND PROPOSAL 

The second proposition was for the govern- 
ment to send picked Chinese youths abroad to be 
thoroughly educated for the public service. The 
scheme contemplated the education of one hun- 
dred and twenty students as an experiment. 
These one hundred and twenty students were to 
be divided into four installments of thirty 
students each, one installment to be sent out 
each year. They were to have fifteen years 
to finish their education. Their average age was 
to be from twelve to fourteen years. If the 
first and second installments proved to be a suc- 
cess, the scheme was to be continued indefinitely. 
Chinese teachers were to be provided to keep up 
their knowledge of Chinese while in the United 
States. Over the whole enterprise two commis- 
sioners were to be appointed, and the govern- 
ment was to appropriate a certain percentage of 
the Shanghai customs to maintain the mission. 

THIRD PROPOSAL 

The third proposition was to induce the gov- 
ernment to open the mineral resources of the 
country and thus in an indirect way lead to the 



174 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

necessity of introducing railroads to transport 
the mineral products from the interior to the 
ports. 

I did not expect this proposition to be adopted 
and carried out, because China at that time had 
no mining engineers who could be depended 
upon to develop the mines, nor were the people 
free from the Fung Shui superstition.* I had no 
faith whatever in the success of this proposition, 
but simply put it in writing to show how ambi- 
tious I was to have the government wake up to 
the possibilities of the development of its vast 
resources. 

FOUETH PROPOSAL 

The encroachment of foreign powers upon the 
independent sovereignty of China has always 
been watched by me with the most intense inter- 
est. No one who is at all acquainted with Roman 
Catholicism can fail to be impressed with the 
unwarranted pretensions and assumptions of the 
Romish church in China. She claims civil juris- 

*The doctrine held by the Chinese in relation to the spirits or 
genii that rule over winds and waters, especially running streams 
and subterranean waters. This doctrine is universal and inveterate 
among the Chinese, and in a great measure prompts their hostility 
to railroads and telegraphs, since they believe that such structures 
anger the spirits of the air and waters and consequently cause 
floods and typhoons. Standard Dictionary. 



MY EDUCATIONAL SCHEME 175 

diction over her proselytes, and takes civil and 
criminal cases out of Chinese courts* In order to 
put a stop to such insidious and crafty workings 
to gain temporal power in China, I put forth 
this proposition: to prohibit missionaries of any 
religious sect or denomination from exercising 
any kind of jurisdiction over their converts, in 
either civil or criminal cases. These four propo- 
sitions were carefully drawn up, and were pre- 
sented to Governor Ting for transmission to 
Peking. 

Of the four proposals, the first, third and 
fourth were put in to chaperone the second, in 
which my whole heart was enlisted, and which 
above all others was the one I wanted to be taken 
up ; but not to give it too prominent a place, at the 
suggestion of my Chinese teacher, it was as- 
signed a second place in the order of the arrange- 
ment. Governor Ting recognized this, and ac- 
cordingly wrote to Prime Minister Wen Seang 
and forwarded the proposals to Peking. Two 
months later, a letter from Ting, at Suchau, his 
headquarters, gave me to understand that news 
from Peking had reached him that Wen Seang's 
mother had died, and he was obliged, according 
to Chinese laws and customs, to retire from office 



176 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

and go into mourning for a period of twenty- 
seven months, equivalent to three years, and to 
abstain altogether from public affairs of all 
kinds. This news threw a cold blanket over my 
educational scheme for the time being. No sooner 
had one misfortune happened than another took 
its place, worst than the first Wen Seang him- 
self, three months afterwards, was overtaken by 
death during his retirement. This announce- 
ment appeared in the Peking "Gazette," which I 
saw, besides being officially informed of it by 
Governor Ting. No one who had a pet scheme 
to promote or a hobby to ride could feel more 
blue than I did, when the cup of joy held so near 
to his lips was dashed from him. I was not entire- 
ly disheartened by such circumstances, but had an 
abiding faith that my educational scheme would 
in the end come out all right. There was an 
interval of at least three years of suspense and 
waiting between 1868 and 1870. I kept pegging 
at Governor Ting, urging him to keep the sub- 
ject constantly before Viceroy Tsang's mind. 
But like the fate of all measures of reform, it had 
to abide its time and opportunity. 

The time and the opportunity for my educa- 
tional scheme to materialize finally came. Con- 
trary to all human expectations, the opportunity 



MY EDUCATIONAL SCHEME 177 

appeared in the guise of the Tientsin Massacre. 
No more did Samson, when he slew the Tim- 
nath lion, expect to extract honey from its 
carcass than did I expect to extract from the 
slaughter of the French nuns and Sisters of 
Charity the educational scheme that was destined 
to make a new China of the old, and to work out 
an Oriental civilization on an Occidental basis. 

The Tientsin Massacre took place early in 
1870. It arose from the gross ignorance and 
superstition of the Tientsin populace regarding 
the work of the nuns and Sisters of Charity, part 
of whose religious duty it was to rescue found- 
lings and castaway orphans, who were gathered 
into hospitals, cared for and educated for the 
services of the Roman Catholic church. This 
beneficent work was misunderstood and miscon- 
strued by the ignorant masses, who really be- 
lieved in the rumors and stories that the infants 
and children thus gathered in were taken into 
the hospitals and churches to have their eyes 
gouged out for medical and religious purposes. 
Such diabolical reports soon spread like wild-fire 
till popular excitement was worked up to its 
highest pitch of frenzy, and the infuriated mob, 
regardless of death and fearless of law, plunged 
headlong into the Tientsin Massacre. In that 



178 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

massacre a Protestant church was burned and 
destroyed, as was also a Roman Catholic church 
and hospital; several nuns or Sisters of Charity 
were killed. 

At the time of this occurrence, Chung Hou 
was viceroy of the Metropolitan province. He 
had been ambassador to Russia previously, but 
in this unfortunate affair, according to Chinese 
law, he was held responsible, was degraded from 
office and banished. The whole imbroglio was 
finally settled and patched up by the payment of 
an indemnity to the relatives and friends of the 
victims of the massacre and the rebuilding of 
the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, 
another Catholic hospital, besides a suitable 
official apology made by the government for the 
incident. Had the French government not been 
handicapped by the impending German War 
which threatened her at the time, France would 
certainly have made the Tientsin Massacre a 
casus belli, and another slice of the Chinese 
Empire would have been annexed to the French 
possessions in Asia. As it was, Tonquin, a trib- 
utary state of China, was afterwards unscrupu- 
lously wrenched from her. 

In the settlement of the massacre, the Imperial 
commissioners appointed were: Viceroy Tsang 



MY EDUCATIONAL SCHEME 179 

Kwoh Fan, Mow Chung Hsi, Liu * * * and 
Ting Yih Chang, Governor of Kiang Su. Li 
Hung Chang was still in the field finishing up 
the Nienfi rebellion, otherwise he, too, would have 
been appointed to take part in the proceedings 
of the settlement. I was telegraphed for by my 
friend, Ting Yih Chang, to be present to act as 
interpreter on the occasion, but the telegram did 
not reach me in time for me to accompany him to 
Tientsin; but I reached Tientsin in time to wit- 
ness the last proceedings* The High Commis- 
sioners, after the settlement with the French, for 
some reason or other, did not disband, but re- 
mained in Tientsin for several days. They evi- 
dently had other matters of State connected with 
Chung Hou's degradation and banishment to 
consider.
