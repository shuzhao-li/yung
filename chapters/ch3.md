CHAPTER III 

JOURNEY TO AMERICA AND FIRST 
EXPERIENCES THERE 

Being thus generously provided for, we em- 
barked at Whompoa on the 4th of January, 
1847, in the good ship "Huntress" under 
Captain Gillespie. As stated above, she be- 
longed to the Olyphant Brothers and was loaded 
with a full cargo of tea. We had the northeast 
trade wind in our favor, which blew strong and 
steady all the way from Whompoa to St. 
Helena. There was no accident of any kind, ex- 
cepting a gale as we doubled the Cape of Good 
Hope. The tops of the masts and ends of the 
yards were tipped with balls of electricity. The 
strong wind was howling and whistling behind 
us like a host of invisible Furies. The night 
was pitch dark and the electric balls dancing 
on the tips of the yards and tops of the masts, 
back and forth and from side to side like so many 
infernal lanterns in the black night, presented a 
spectacle never to be forgotten by me. I realized 
no danger, although the ship pitched and

groaned, but enjoyed the wild and weird scene 
hugely. After the Cape was doubled, our vessel 
ploughed through the comparatively smooth 
waters of the Atlantic until we reached the 
Island of St. Helena where we were obliged to 
stop for fresh water and provisions. Most 
sailing vessels that were bound from the East 
for the Atlantic board were accustomed to make 
St. Helena their stopping place, St. Helena, as 
viewed from the shipboard, presented an outward 
appearance of a barren volcanic rock, as though 
freshly emerged from the baptism of fire and 
brimstone. Not a blade of grass could be seen 
on its burnt and charred surface. We landed at 
Jamestown, which is a small village in the valley 
of the Island. In this valley there was rich and 
Beautiful vegetation. We found among the 
sparse inhabitants a few Chinese who were 
brought there by the East India Company's 
ships. They were middle-aged people, and had 
their families there. While there, we went over 
to Longwood where was Napoleon's empty 
tomb. A large weeping willow hung and swept 
over it. We cut a few twigs, and kept them alive 
till we reached this country and they were 
brought to Auburn, N. Y., by Mr. Brown, who 
planted them near Ms residence when he was

teaching in the Auburn Academy for several 
years before his departure for Japan. These 
willows proved to be fine, handsome trees when 
I visited Auburn in 1854. 

From St. Helena we took a northwesterly 
course and struck the Gulf Stream, which, with 
the wind still fair and favorable, carried us to 
New York in a short time. We landed in New 
York on the 12th of April, 1847, after a passage 
of ninety-eight days of unprecedented fair 
weather. The New York of 1847 was altogether 
a different city from the New York of 1909. It 
was a city of only 250,000 or 300,000 inhabi- 
tants ; now it is a metropolis rivaling London in 
population, wealth and commerce. The whole 
of Manhattan Island is turned into a city of sky- 
scrapers, churches and palatial residences. 

Little did I realize when in 1845 I wrote, while 
in the Morrison School, a composition on "An 
Imaginary Voyage to New York and up the 
Hudson," that I was to see New York in reality. 
This incident leads me to the reflection that 
sometimes our imagination foreshadows what lies 
uppermost in our minds and brings possibilities 
within the sphere of realities. The Chinese 
Education Scheme is another example of the 
realities that came out of my day dreams a 



24 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

year before I graduated. So was my marrying 
an American wife. Still there are other day 
dreams yet to be realized; whether or no they 
will ever come to pass the future will determine. 

Our stay in New York was brief. The first 
friends we had the good fortune to make in the 
new world, were Prof. David E. Bartlett and 
his wife. He was a professor in the New York 
Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, and was after- 
wards connected with a like institution in Hart- 
ford. The Professor died in 1879. His wife, 
Mrs, Fanny P. Bartlett, survived him for nearly 
thirty years and passed away in the spring of 
1907. She was a woman highly respected and 
beloved for her high Christian character and un- 
ceasing activities for good in the community in 
which she lived. Her influence was even extend- 
ed to China by the few students who happened 
to enjoy her care and instruction. I count her 
as one of my most valued friends in America. 

From New York we proceeded by boat to 
New Haven where we had an opportunity to see 
Yale College and were introduced to President 
Day. I had not then the remotest idea of be- 
coming a graduate of one of the finest colleges 
of the country, as I did a few years afterwards. 
We went by rail from New Haven to Ware-

house Point and from there to East Windsor, 
the home of Mrs. Elizabeth Brown, wife of Dr. 
Brown. Her parents were then living. Her 
father, the Rev. Shuhael Bartlett, was the pastor 
of the East Windsor Congregational Church. I 
well remember the first Sabbath we attended his 
church. We three Chinese boys sat in the 
pastor's pew which was on the left of the pulpit, 
having a side view of the minister, but in full 
view of the whole congregation. We were the 
cynosure of the whole church, I doubt whether 
much attention was paid to the sermon that day. 
The Rev. Shubael Bartlett was a genuine type 
of the old New England Puritan. He was exact 
and precise in all his manners and ways. He 
spoke in a deliberate and solemn tone, but full of 
sincerity and earnestness. He conducted him- 
self as though he was treading on thin ice, cau- 
tiously and circumspectly. One would suppose 
from his appearance that he was austere and 
exacting, but he was gentle and thoughtful. He 
would have his family Bible and hymn book 
placed one on top of the other, squared and in 
straight lines, on the same spot on the table every 
morning for morning prayers. He always sat 
in the same spot for morning prayers. In other 
words, you always knew where to find him. His 



26 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

habits and daily life were as regular as clock 
work. I never heard him crack a joke or hurst 
out in open laughter. 

Mrs. Bartlett, Mrs. Brown's mother, was of 
a different makeup. She was always cheerful. 
A smile lighted up her features nearly all the 
time and for everyone she had a kind and cheer- 
ful word, while the sweet tone of her voice always 
carried with it cheerfulness and good will. Her 
genial temperament and her hospitality made 
the parsonage a favorite resort to all the friends 
and relatives of the family, who were quite 
numerous. It was always a puzzle to me how 
the old lady managed to make ends meet when 
her husband's salary was not over $400 a year. 
To be sure, the farm annually realized some- 
thing, but Daniel, the youngest son, who was the 
staff of the old couple, had to work hard to keep 
up the prestige of the parsonage. It was in this 
parsonage that I found a temporary home while 
at school in Monson, and also in Yale.
