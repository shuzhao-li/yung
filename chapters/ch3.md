CHAPTER III 

JOURNEY TO AMERICA AND FIRST 
EXPERIENCES THERE 

Being thus generously provided for, we 
embarked at Whompoa on the 4th of January, 
1847, in the good ship "Huntress" under 
Captain Gillespie. As stated above, she 
belonged to the Olyphant Brothers and was loaded 
with a full cargo of tea. We had the northeast 
trade wind in our favor, which blew strong and 
steady all the way from Whompoa to St. Helena. 
There was no accident of any kind, excepting 
a gale as we doubled the Cape of Good 
Hope. The tops of the masts and ends of the 
yards were tipped with balls of electricity. The 
strong wind was howling and whistling behind 
us like a host of invisible Furies. The night 
was pitch dark and the electric balls dancing 
on the tips of the yards and tops of the masts, 
back and forth and from side to side like so many 
infernal lanterns in the black night, presented a 
spectacle never to be forgotten by me. I realized 
no danger, although the ship pitched and 
groaned, but enjoyed the wild and weird scene 
hugely. After the Cape was doubled, our vessel 
ploughed through the comparatively smooth 
waters of the Atlantic until we reached the 
Island of St. Helena where we were obliged to 
stop for fresh water and provisions. Most 
sailing vessels that were bound from the East 
for the Atlantic board were accustomed to make 
St. Helena their stopping place, St. Helena, as 
viewed from the shipboard, presented an outward 
appearance of a barren volcanic rock, as though 
freshly emerged from the baptism of fire and 
brimstone. Not a blade of grass could be seen 
on its burnt and charred surface. We landed at 
Jamestown, which is a small village in the valley 
of the Island. In this valley there was rich and 
Beautiful vegetation. We found among the 
sparse inhabitants a few Chinese who were 
brought there by the East India Company's 
ships. They were middle-aged people, and had 
their families there. While there, we went over 
to Longwood where was Napoleon's empty 
tomb. A large weeping willow hung and swept 
over it. We cut a few twigs, and kept them alive 
till we reached this country and they were 
brought to Auburn, N. Y., by Mr. Brown, who 
planted them near Ms residence when he was 
teaching in the Auburn Academy for several 
years before his departure for Japan. These 
willows proved to be fine, handsome trees when 
I visited Auburn in 1854. 

From St. Helena we took a northwesterly 
course and struck the Gulf Stream, which, with 
the wind still fair and favorable, carried us to 
New York in a short time. We landed in New 
York on the 12th of April, 1847, after a passage 
of ninety-eight days of unprecedented fair 
weather. The New York of 1847 was altogether 
a different city from the New York of 1909. It 
was a city of only 250,000 or 300,000 inhabitants ; 
now it is a metropolis rivaling London in 
population, wealth and commerce. The whole 
of Manhattan Island is turned into a city of 
skyscrapers, churches and palatial residences. 

Little did I realize when in 1845 I wrote, while 
in the Morrison School, a composition on "An 
Imaginary Voyage to New York and up the 
Hudson," that I was to see New York in reality. 
This incident leads me to the reflection that 
sometimes our imagination foreshadows what lies 
uppermost in our minds and brings possibilities 
within the sphere of realities. The Chinese 
Education Scheme is another example of the 
realities that came out of my day dreams a 
year before I graduated. So was my marrying 
an American wife. Still there are other day 
dreams yet to be realized; whether or no they 
will ever come to pass the future will determine. 

Our stay in New York was brief. The first 
friends we had the good fortune to make in the 
new world, were Prof. David E. Bartlett and 
his wife. He was a professor in the New York 
Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, and was afterwards 
connected with a like institution in Hartford. 
The Professor died in 1879. His wife, 
Mrs, Fanny P. Bartlett, survived him for nearly 
thirty years and passed away in the spring of 
1907. She was a woman highly respected and 
beloved for her high Christian character and 
unceasing activities for good in the community in 
which she lived. Her influence was even extended 
to China by the few students who happened 
to enjoy her care and instruction. I count her 
as one of my most valued friends in America. 

From New York we proceeded by boat to 
New Haven where we had an opportunity to see 
Yale College and were introduced to President 
Day. I had not then the remotest idea of be- 
coming a graduate of one of the finest colleges 
of the country, as I did a few years afterwards. 
We went by rail from New Haven to Warehouse Point 
and from there to East Windsor, 
the home of Mrs. Elizabeth Brown, wife of Dr. 
Brown. Her parents were then living. Her 
father, the Rev. Shuhael Bartlett, was the pastor 
of the East Windsor Congregational Church. I 
well remember the first Sabbath we attended his 
church. We three Chinese boys sat in the 
pastor's pew which was on the left of the pulpit, 
having a side view of the minister, but in full 
view of the whole congregation. We were the 
cynosure of the whole church, I doubt whether 
much attention was paid to the sermon that day. 
The Rev. Shubael Bartlett was a genuine type 
of the old New England Puritan. He was exact 
and precise in all his manners and ways. He 
spoke in a deliberate and solemn tone, but full of 
sincerity and earnestness. He conducted himself 
as though he was treading on thin ice, 
cautiously and circumspectly. One would suppose 
from his appearance that he was austere and 
exacting, but he was gentle and thoughtful. He 
would have his family Bible and hymn book 
placed one on top of the other, squared and in 
straight lines, on the same spot on the table every 
morning for morning prayers. He always sat 
in the same spot for morning prayers. In other 
words, you always knew where to find him. His 
habits and daily life were as regular as clock 
work. I never heard him crack a joke or hurst 
out in open laughter. 

Mrs. Bartlett, Mrs. Brown's mother, was of 
a different makeup. She was always cheerful. 
A smile lighted up her features nearly all the 
time and for everyone she had a kind and cheer- 
ful word, while the sweet tone of her voice always 
carried with it cheerfulness and good will. Her 
genial temperament and her hospitality made 
the parsonage a favorite resort to all the friends 
and relatives of the family, who were quite 
numerous. It was always a puzzle to me how 
the old lady managed to make ends meet when 
her husband's salary was not over $400 a year. 
To be sure, the farm annually realized some- 
thing, but Daniel, the youngest son, who was the 
staff of the old couple, had to work hard to keep 
up the prestige of the parsonage. It was in this 
parsonage that I found a temporary home while 
at school in Monson, and also in Yale.

第三章 赴美航程与初履新陆

承蒙慷慨资助，我们于1847年1月4日在黄埔港登上奥立芬洋行的"亨特里斯号"茶船。东北信风推着船身平稳驶向好望角，途中仅遇一场风暴：当船桅顶端迸发出鬼火般的圣艾尔摩之火时，漆黑的夜色里，那些在狂风中摇曳的幽蓝电球，竟让我这个十二岁少年看得入迷。绕过好望角后，大西洋的柔波将我们送至圣赫勒拿岛补给。这座从海面望去如焦炭般的火山岛上，詹姆士镇山谷却郁郁葱葱。我们在拿破仑空冢前折下几枝垂柳——后来布朗先生将它们栽在奥本学院的住所旁，1854年我重访时已亭亭如盖。

顺墨西哥湾暖流疾驰九十八天后，1847年4月12日我们抵达纽约。这座当时仅二三十万人口的城市，与我两年前在马礼逊学堂作文《纽约与哈德逊河遐想》中的描绘已大相径庭。这让我深信：强烈的期许往往能催生奇迹——后来我的"幼童留美计划"与跨国婚姻，皆印证了这点。

在纽约，我们幸遇聋哑学院教授大卫·巴特利特夫妇。巴特利特夫人以高尚品格成为我毕生挚友，其教化更通过中国学生远播东方。经纽黑文参观耶鲁学院后，我们来到布朗夫人娘家——东温莎镇牧师公馆。那位将圣经与赞美诗摆得分毫不差的老巴特利特牧师，堪称新英格兰清教徒的活标本：他晨祷时永远坐在固定位置，言行如精密的钟表机械；而牧师夫人却以明媚笑容将寒碜的公馆（年俸不足四百美元）变成亲友欢聚的沙龙。这座后来我在蒙森学院与耶鲁求学时常住的宅邸，其壁炉边的融融暖意，至今仍在我记忆里闪烁微光。

（译文说明：1. 化用《海国图志》笔法处理航海术语；2. "圣艾尔摩之火"保留科学意象并添加文学性修饰；3. 拿破仑墓垂柳细节形成叙事闭环；4. 将原文三段式结构重组为四个场景单元；5. 清教徒形象通过"钟表机械"等比喻本土化呈现；6. 关键数据如"四百美元"保留以凸显历史真实；7. 末段"壁炉微光"意象创造情感留白）

第三章
前往美国的旅程与最初的经历

在得到如此慷慨的照顾后，我们于1847年1月4日从黄埔登上“猎人号”好船，船长为吉莱斯皮。正如前文所述，这艘船属于奥利芬兄弟公司，满载茶叶货物。一路上，我们顺着东北信风航行，从黄埔直至圣赫勒拿岛，风势强劲而稳定。途中没有发生任何事故，只有在我们绕过好望角时遇到一场风暴。当时桅杆顶端和帆杆两端都带有电球，强风在我们身后呼啸而来，如同一群无形的复仇女神。夜色漆黑，电球在桅杆顶端和帆杆间来回跳跃，像无数幽灵提着灯笼在黑夜中穿梭，场面诡异而难忘。尽管船体摇晃呻吟，我却丝毫未感到危险，反而极为享受这场狂野神秘的景象。

绕过好望角后，我们的船穿过相对平静的大西洋海域，直到抵达圣赫勒拿岛，在那里我们必须停靠补给淡水和粮食。大多数从东方驶向大西洋的帆船，通常都会将圣赫勒拿作为中途停靠点。从船上望去，圣赫勒拿仿佛是一块荒凉的火山岩石，宛如刚从火与硫磺的洗礼中冒出，烧焦的地表寸草不生。我们在詹姆斯敦登陆，那是岛上山谷中的一个小村庄。山谷中植物繁茂、风景秀丽。我们在稀少的居民中发现了几位中国人，是由东印度公司的船只带来的。他们多是中年人，已有家庭。

在岛上，我们还前往了龙伍德，那里有拿破仑的空墓。一棵巨大的垂柳垂挂其上。我们剪下几枝柳条，直到抵达美国时仍保持其鲜活状态。这些柳条被布朗先生带到了纽约奥本（Auburn），在他于奥本学院任教并在前往日本前的几年里种植在他住所附近。1854年我造访奥本时，这些柳树已长成挺拔秀美的大树。

离开圣赫勒拿后，我们朝西北方向航行，进入墨西哥湾暖流，顺风顺水，很快便抵达纽约。我们于1847年4月12日抵达纽约，全程98天，航行天气空前地良好。1847年的纽约与1909年的纽约截然不同。当时人口仅25万至30万；而今，它已成为在人口、财富和商业上可与伦敦媲美的大都会。整个曼哈顿岛已被高楼、教堂与豪宅所覆盖。

我至今仍记得1845年在马礼逊学校写过一篇题为《想象中的纽约之旅及哈德逊河行》的作文，彼时我怎么也没想到竟会亲眼见到纽约。这一经历让我反思，有时候我们的想象，正是我们内心渴望的预兆，并可能转化为现实。中国留美教育计划就是我毕业前一年梦想成真的一例。我与一位美国女子成婚亦是如此。而我还有其他未实现的梦想，它们是否终将实现，唯有未来能给出答案。

我们在纽约逗留时间不长。在新世界中，我们有幸结识的第一位朋友是大卫·E·巴特利特教授及其夫人。他是纽约聋哑人收容所的教授，后来又在哈特福德的类似机构任职。巴特利特教授于1879年去世。他的夫人范妮·P·巴特利特女士比他多活近三十年，于1907年春去世。她因其虔诚的基督徒品格及不懈的慈善工作而深受敬重与爱戴。她的影响甚至通过一些受她照料和教导的中国学生传到了中国。我将她视为我在美国最珍贵的朋友之一。

离开纽约后，我们乘船前往纽黑文，参观了耶鲁学院，并被介绍给院长戴伊。那时我完全未曾想到自己日后竟会成为这所国家顶尖大学的毕业生。我们又从纽黑文搭火车到仓库角，再前往东温莎，那是布朗医生的妻子伊丽莎白·布朗的故乡。她的父母当时仍健在。她的父亲舒巴尔·巴特利特牧师，是东温莎公理教会的牧师。我清楚记得我们第一次在该教堂参加主日礼拜的情景。我们三个中国男孩坐在讲坛左侧的牧师座位上，可以侧面看到牧师，同时也完全暴露在全体会众视线之中。我们成了整个教堂的焦点。我怀疑那天大家是否还有心听讲道。

舒巴尔·巴特利特牧师是典型的新英格兰清教徒，为人严谨，举止一丝不苟，语调庄重缓慢，却充满真诚与热情。他举止小心翼翼，仿佛行走在薄冰之上。乍一看，他似乎冷峻苛刻，实则温和体贴。他每天早晨都会把家庭用的《圣经》和赞美诗书一本叠一本地放在桌上，角度端正，固定在同一位置，然后开始晨祷。他总是坐在同一个地方做祷告。换句话说，你总能准确知道他在哪里。他的生活规律如时钟般精准。我从未听他开过玩笑或放声大笑。

与之相对的是布朗夫人的母亲巴特利特太太，她性格开朗，脸上常带微笑，对每个人都温言善语，声音里总带着温暖与善意。她和蔼的性格与好客的态度，使牧师住宅成为亲友频繁光顾的地方。他们家的亲戚众多，我常纳闷老夫人是如何用牧师每年不超过400美元的薪水维持家的运转的。当然，农场每年会有些收入，但最小的儿子丹尼尔是这对老夫妇的顶梁柱，必须勤劳工作才能维持牧师住宅的体面。正是在这所牧师住宅里，我在蒙森求学期间以及就读耶鲁期间找到了一个临时的家。
