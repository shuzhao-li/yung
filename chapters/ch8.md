CHAPTER VIII 
EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 

The next turn I took, after leaving the 
Imperial Customs, was clerk in an English 
house tea and silk merchants. During the 
few months that I was with them, I gained quite 
an insight into mercantile business, and the 
methods of conducting it, which proved to be 
profitable knowledge and experience to me later 
on. Six months after I had entered upon my 
new sphere as a make-shift, the firm dissolved 
partnership, which once more threw me out of 
a position, and I was again cast upon the sea 
of uncertainty. But during my connection with 
the firm, two little incidents occurred which I 
must not fail to relate. 

One Thursday evening, as I was returning 
home from a prayer meeting held in the Union 
Chapel in Shanghai, I saw ahead of me on 
Szechuen Road in front of the Episcopal 
church, a string of men; each had a Chinese lan- 
tern swinging in the air over his head, and they 
were singing and shouting as they zigzagged 
along the road, evidently having a jolly, good 
time, while Chinese on hoth sides of the road 
were seen dodging and scampering about in 
great fright in all directions, and acting as though 
they were chased by the Old Nick himself. I 
was at a distance of about one hundred yards 
from the scene. I took in the situation at once. 
My servant, who held a lantern ahead of me, to 
light the way, was so frightened that he began 
to come back towards me. I told him not to be 
afraid, but walk right straight ahead. Pretty 
soon we confronted three or four of the fellows, 
half tipsy. One of them snatched the lantern 
from my servant and another, staggering about, 
tried to give me a kick. I walked along coolly 
and unconcerned till I reached the last batch of 
two or three fellows. I found these quite sober 
and In their senses and they were lingering be- 
hind evidently to enjoy the fun and watch the 
crowd in their hilarious antics. I stopped and 
parleyed with them, and told them who I 
was, I asked them for the names of the 
fellows who snatched my boy's lantern and of 
the fellow who tried to kick me. They deelined 
at first, but finally with the promise that I would 
not give them any trouble, they gave me the 
name of one of the fellows, his position on the 
vessel, and the name of the vessel he belonged 
to. It turned out that the man was the first 
mate of the ship "Eureka," the very vessel that 
brought me out to China, in 1855, and which 
happened to be consigned to the firm I was 
working for. The next morning, I wrote a note 
to the captain, asking him to hand the note to 
his first officer. The captain, on receiving the 
note, was quite excited, and handed it to the first 
mate, who immediately came ashore and apol- 
ogized. I made it very pleasant for him and 
told him that Americans in China were held in 
high esteem by the people, and every American 
landing in China should be jealous of the high 
estimation in which they were held and not do 
anything to compromise it. My motive in 
writing the note was merely to get him on shore 
and give him this advice. He was evidently 
pleased with my friendly attitude and extended 
his hand for a shake to thank me for the advice. 
He invited me to go on board with him to take a 
glass of wine and be good friends. I thanked 
him for his offer, but declined it, and we parted 
in an amicable way. 

My second incident, which happened a couple 
of months after the first, did not have such a 
peaceful ending. 

After the partnership of the firm, in whose 
employ I was, dissolved, an auction sale of the 
furniture of the firm took place. In the room 
where the auction was proceeding, I happened 
to be standing in a mixed crowd of Chinese 
and foreigners. A stalwart six-footer of a 
Scotchman happened to be standing behind 
me. He was not altogether a stranger to me, 
for I had met him in the streets several times. 
He began to tie a bunch of cotton balls to my 
queue, simply for a lark. But I caught him at 
it and in a pleasant way held it up and asked 
him to untie it. He folded up his arms and drew 
himself straight up with a look of the utmost 
disdain and scorn. I at once took in the situa- 
tion, and as my countenance sobered, I reiterated 
my demand to have the appendage taken off. 
All of a sudden, he thrust his fist against my 
mouth, without drawing any blood, however. 
Although he stood head and shoulders above me 
in height, yet I was not at all abashed or intimi- 
dated by his burly and contemptuous appear- 
ance. My dander was up and oblivious to all 
thoughts of our comparative size and strength, 
I struck him back in the identical place where 
he punched me, but iny blow was a stinger and 
it went with lightning rapidity to the spot
without giving him time to think. It drew blood 
in great profusion from lip and nose. He 
caught me by the wrist with both his hands. As 
he held my right wrist in his powerful grasp, for 
he was an athlete and a sportsman, I was just 
on the point of raising my right foot for a kick, 
which was aimed at a vital point, when the head 
partner of the firm, who happened to be near, 
suddenly stepped in between and separated us. 
I then stood off to one side, facing my antag- 
onist, who was moving off into the crowd. As I 
moved away, I was asked by a voice from the 
crowd : 

"Do you want to fight?" 

I said, "No, I was only defending myself. 
Your friend insulted me and added injury to 
insult. I took him for a gentleman, but he has 
proved himself a blackguard." 

With this stinging remark, which was heard 
all over the room, I retired from the scene into 
an adjoining room, leaving the crowd to com- 
ment on the incident. The British Consul, who 
happened to be present on the occasion, made a 
casual remark on the merits of the case and 
said, as I was told afterwards by a friend, that 
"The young man was a little too fiery; if he 
had not taken the law into his own hands, he 
could have brought suit for assault and battery 
in the consular court, but since he has already 
retaliated and his last remark before the crowd 
has inflicted a deeper cut to his antagonist than 
the blow itself, he has lost the advantage of a 
suit" 

The Scotchman, after the incident, did not 
appear in public for a whole week. I was told 
he had shut himself up in his room to give his 
wound time to heal, but the reason he did not 
care to show himself was more on account of 
being whipped by a little Chinaman in a public 
manner; for the affair, unpleasant and unfor- 
tunate as it was, created quite a sensation in the 
settlement. It was the chief topic of conversa- 
tion for a short time among foreigners, while 
among the Chinese I was looked upon with great 
respect, for since the foreign settlement on the 
extra-territorial basis was established close to 
the city of Shanghai, no Chinese within its juris- 
diction had ever been known to have the courage 
and pluck to defend his rights, point blank, when 
they had been violated or trampled upon by a 
foreigner. Their meek and mild disposition had 
allowed personal insults and affronts to pass 
unresented and unchallenged, which naturally 
had the tendency to encourage arrogance and 
insolence on the part of ignorant foreigners. 
The time will soon come, however, when the 
people of China will be so educated and enlight- 
ened as to know what their rights are, public 
and private, and to have the moral courage to 
assert and defend them whenever they are 
invaded. The triumph of Japan over Russia in 
the recent war has opened the eyes of the 
Chinese world. It will never tolerate injustice 
in any way or shape, much less will it put up 
with foreign aggression and aggrandizement 
any longer. They see now in what plight their 
national ignorance, conceit and conservatism, in 
which they had been fossilized, had placed them. 
They were on the verge of being partitioned by 
the European Powers and were saved from that 
catastrophe only by the timely intervention of the 
United States government. What the future 
will bring forth, since the Emperor Kwangsu 
and Dowager Empress Chi Hsi have both 
passed away, no one can predict. 

The breaking up of the firm by which I was 
employed, once more, as stated before, and for 
the fourth time, threw me out of a regular busi- 
ness. But I was not at all disconcerted or 
discouraged, for I had no idea of following a 
mercantile life as a permanent calling. Within 
the past two years, my knowledge of the Chinese 
language had decidedly improved. I was not in 
hot haste to seek for a new position. I imme- 
diately took to translating as a means of bridg- 
ing over the breaks of a desultory life. This 
independent avocation, though not a lucrative 
one, nevertheless led the way to a wider 
acquaintance with the educated and mercantile 
classes of the Chinese; to widen my acquaintance 
was my chief concern. My translating business 
brought me in contact with the comprador of 
one of the leading houses in Shanghai. The 
senior partner of this house died in 1857. He 
was well-known and thought much of by both 
the Chinese and the foreign mercantile body. To 
attest their high regard for his memory, the 
prominent Chinese merchants drew up an elab- 
orate and eulogistic epitaph on the occasion of 
his death. The surviving members of the firm 
selected two translators to translate the epitaph. 
One was the interpreter in the British Consulate 
General, a brother to the author of "The Chinese 
and their Rebellions/' and the other was 
(through the influence of the comprador) my- 
self. To my great surprise, my translation was 
given the preference and accepted by the man- 
ager of the firm. The Chinese committee were 
quite elated that one of their countrymen knew 
enough English to bring out the inner sense of 
their epitaph. It was adopted and engraved on 
the monument. My name began to be known 
among the Chinese, not as a fighter this time, 
but as a Chinese student educated in America, 

Soon after this performance, another event 
unexpectedly came up in which I was again 
called upon to act; that was the inundation of the 
Yellow River, which had converted the northern 
part of Kiangsu province into a sea, and made 
homeless and destitute thousands of people of 
that locality. A large body of refugees had 
wandered to and flocked near Shanghai. A 
Chinese deputation, consisting of the leading 
merchants and gentry, who knew or had heard of 
me, called and asked me to draw up a circular 
appealing to the foreign community for aid and 
contributions to relieve the widespread suffering 
among the refugees. Several copies were imme- 
diately put into circulation and in less than a 
week, no less than $20,000 were subscribed and 
paid. The Chinese Committee were greatly 
elated over their success and their joy was 
unbounded. To give a finishing touch to this 
stroke of business, I wrote in the name of the 
committee a letter of acknowledgment and 
thanks to the foreign community for the prompt 
and generous contribution it had made. This 
was published in the Shanghai local papers 
"The Shanghai Mail" and "Friend of China" so 
that inside of three months after I had started 
my translating business, I had become widely 
known among the Chinese as the Chinese student 
educated in America. I was indebted to Tsang 
Kee Foo, the comprador, for being in this line 
of business, and for the fact that I was becoming 
known in Shanghai. He was a well-educated 
Chinese a man highly respected and trusted 
for his probity and intelligence. His long con- 
nection with the firm and his literary taste had 
gathered around him some of the finest Chinese 
scholars from all parts of China, while his 
business transactions brought him in touch with 
the leading Chinese capitalists and business men 
in Shanghai and elsewhere. It was through him 
that both the epitaph and the circular men- 
tioned above were written; and it was Tsang 
Kee Foo who introduced me to the celebrated 
Chinese mathematician, Li Jen Shu, who years 
afterwards brought me to the notice of Viceroy 
Tsang Kwoh Fan the distinguished general 
and statesman, who, as will be seen hereafter, 
took up and promoted the Chinese Education 
Scheme. In the great web of human affairs, it 
is almost impossible to know who among our 
friends and acquaintances may prove to be the 
right clue to unravel the skein of our destiny. 
Tsang Kee Foo introduced me to Li Jen Shu, 
the latter introduced me to Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
who finally through the Chinese Education 
Scheme grafted Western education to the Orien- 
tal culture, a union destined to weld together the 
different races of the world into one brotherhood. 
My friend Tsang Kee Foo afterwards intro- 
duced me to the head or manager of Messrs. 
Dent & Co,, who kindly offered me a position in 
his firm as comprador in Nagasaki, Japan, soon 
after that country was opened to foreign trade. 
I declined the situation, frankly and plainly 
stating my reason, which was that the com- 
pradorship, though lucrative, is associated with 
all that is menial, and that as a graduate 
of Yale, one of the leading colleges in America, 
I could not think of bringing discredit to my 
Alma Mater, for which I entertained the most 
profound respect and reverence, and was jealous 
of her proud fame. What would the college and 
my class-mates think of me, if they should hear 
that I was a comprador the head servant of 
servants in an English establishment? I said 
there were cases when a man from stress of 
circumstances may be compelled to play the part 
of a menial for a shift, but I was not yet reduced 
to that strait, though I was poor financially. I 
told him I would prefer to travel for the firm as 
its agent in the interior and correspond directly 
with the head of the firm. In that case, I would 
not sacrifice my manhood for the sake of making 
money in a position which is commonly held to 
be servile, I would much prefer to pack tea and 
buy silk as an agent either on a salary or on 
commission. Such was my ground for declining. 
I, however, thanked him for the offer. This inter- 
view took place in the presence of my friend, 
Tsang Kee Foo, who without knowing the 
details of the conversation, knew enough of the 
English language to follow the general tenor of 
the talk. I then retired and left the manager 
and my friend to talk over the result. Tsang 
afterwards told me that Webb said, "Yung 
Wing is poor but proud. Poverty and pride 
usually go together, hand in hand." A few days 
afterwards Tsang informed me that Webb had 
decided to send me to the tea districts to see and 
learn the business of packing tea.

第八章
经商经历

我从中国海关离职后，接下来的工作是在一家英商茶叶与丝绸公司担任职员。在我为这家公司服务的几个月里，我对商业事务和经营方式有了相当深入的了解，这些知识和经验后来对我大有裨益。六个月后，我刚开始适应这份临时工作的节奏，公司却解散了合伙关系，我又一次失去了职位，再次被抛入了充满不确定性的生活之海。但在我为这家公司工作期间，发生了两件小事，我不能不提。

某个星期四晚上，我从上海协和礼拜堂的祷告会回家，走到四川路圣公会教堂前时，看到前方有一群人排成一串，每人头上举着一盏中国灯笼，一边唱歌一边大声喧哗，东倒西歪地沿路而行，显然玩得非常尽兴。而路两旁的中国人则惊慌逃窜，仿佛被魔鬼追赶一般。我当时离这场景约有一百码远，一下子就明白了状况。我的仆人手持灯笼在前为我照路，他被吓得不轻，开始往我方向退回。我告诉他不要害怕，继续直行。很快我们遇到了三四个半醉的家伙，其中一人抢走了我仆人的灯笼，另一人摇摇晃晃地试图踢我一脚。我冷静而毫不在意地走着，直到最后遇到两三个人，他们看起来很清醒，理智尚存，显然是落在后面欣赏这群人喧闹取乐的模样。我停下来与他们攀谈，说明了自己的身份，并要求他们告诉我那个抢灯笼和试图踢我的人的名字。他们一开始不肯说，但在我承诺不会为难他们之后，他们最终告诉了我那人的名字、他在船上的职位以及船名。原来那人是“尤里卡号”轮船的一副，也就是在1855年把我带到中国的那艘船，而这艘船正好是由我工作的公司代理。第二天早晨，我写了封便条给船长，请他转交给他的副手。船长收到信后十分紧张，将其交给了那位大副。大副随即上岸向我道歉。我以友善的方式接待了他，告诉他美国人在中国受到人们高度敬重，每位在中国登陆的美国人都应珍惜这种尊重，不应做出任何有损声誉的事。我写那封信的目的，仅仅是想让他上岸，好当面给他一些忠告。他显然对我的态度很满意，伸出手来表示感谢。他邀请我随他上船喝杯酒，交个朋友。我婉言谢绝了他的邀请，我们友好地告别了。

第二件事发生在两个月后，结局则不那么和平。

那家公司解散后，举行了一场家具拍卖。我在拍卖房间里，站在由中外人士组成的人群中。一个高大的苏格兰人站在我身后。他并非完全陌生，我以前在街上见过他几次。他开始把一串棉球绑在我的辫子上，纯属取乐。但我当场察觉，便轻松地举起辫子请他解开。他却双臂交叉、挺直身体，用极度轻蔑和鄙视的神情看着我。我立刻明白了情势，神情一变，严肃地再次要求他将附着物取下。突然之间，他一拳打在我嘴上，虽未出血。我虽然比他矮了一头，完全不感到羞愧或害怕。他身材魁梧，神情傲慢，但我的怒火已被点燃，完全不顾我们的体格和力量差异，立刻反击，精准地还击在他出拳的同一位置。我这一拳极其迅捷，打得他毫无还手之机，当场血从嘴唇与鼻子大量流出。他用双手抓住我的右手手腕。他是个运动员，有强健的体魄。当他牢牢握住我的手腕时，我正准备抬起右脚，一脚踢向要害之处，忽然公司的头号合伙人正好靠近，上前将我们隔开。我退到一边，直面那位敌手，他正转身钻入人群。这时有人问我：

“你想打架吗？”

我说：“不，我只是在自卫。他侮辱我，还加以伤害。我原以为他是个君子，结果却是个无赖。”

这番话语铿锵有力，整个屋子都听得一清二楚。我便转身离开，走进了隔壁房间，留人群在原地议论纷纷。据朋友后来转述，英国领事当时也在场，他就此事随口发表意见，说：“这位年轻人火气有点大，如果他没有动手反击，是可以去领事法庭控告对方伤人；但既然已经还手，他最后在众人面前说的那句话比拳头本身更伤人，因此他已失去了提告的优势。”

那位苏格兰人事后整整一个星期没有出现在公众场合。据说他把自己关在屋里疗伤，但更大的原因是他在众目睽睽下被一个中国人教训了。这件不幸却轰动的事件一度成为租界中外人的谈资。而在中国人当中，我则被视为极有胆识的人。自从上海设立外国人治外法权的租界后，从未有一个中国人在遭到外国人侮辱或欺凌时敢于当面反抗。他们温顺的性格让诸多侮辱得以逃脱惩罚，也助长了某些外国人的傲慢与无礼。然而这种时代即将过去，中国人民很快将因教育而觉醒，懂得自身应享有的各种权利，并具备道德勇气去捍卫这些权利。日本在日俄战争中的胜利已经让中国人睁开了眼睛。他们再也不会容忍任何形式的不公，更不会再默许外国的侵略与扩张。他们开始意识到，国家的无知、自负和保守几乎让他们沦为列强瓜分的对象；是美国政府的及时干预，才避免了这一灾难。至于光绪皇帝与慈禧太后相继去世之后中国将何去何从，谁也说不准。

如前所述，那家公司的解散，是我第四次失去稳定的职位。但我并未因此感到气馁或失望，因为我从未打算以商贾为终身职业。过去两年中，我的中文水平有了显著进步，我也无意急于找新工作。于是我立即转向翻译工作，借此度过职业上的空档期。这份自由职业虽不赚钱，却让我得以结识更多中国知识分子与商界人士，而扩大人脉正是我最关心的事。翻译工作让我结识了上海一家大公司的买办。这家公司的一位资深合伙人于1857年去世，在中外商界都享有盛名。为表示对他的敬意，一些著名的中国商人联名起草了一篇缅怀他的悼词。该公司的现存合伙人选定了两位翻译将其译成英文，一位是英国领事馆的通译，他是《中华帝国之叛乱》的作者的兄弟；另一位是在买办推荐下选中的我。令我惊讶的是，我的译文最终被公司经理选中采用。中国方面的委员对一位中国人能将他们的悼文翻译得恰到好处感到非常高兴。该译文被雕刻在纪念碑上。从那时起，我在中国人中不再是以“斗士”闻名，而是以“在美国受过教育的中国学生”著称。

这件事不久，又有一件意外的事件促使我再次出面。那就是黄河决堤，导致江苏北部大片地区被淹成泽国，数以万计的百姓流离失所。一大批难民逃至上海附近。一群知我或听说过我的中国商人和士绅组成代表团前来，请我代为撰写一份通告，向外国侨民发起募捐，以赈济难民之苦。这通告很快印制多份传播出去，不到一周，所募捐款已达两万美元。中国方面的代表对此极为满意，喜不自胜。为圆满结束此次行动，我以委员会的名义致函侨界，感谢他们慷慨解囊，该信被《上海邮报》和《中国之友》两家当地报纸刊登。至此，我从开始翻译工作起不到三个月，已在中国人中广为人知，成为“留美中国学生”的代名词。我非常感激买办曾纪富先生，是他让我进入翻译行当，并使我在上海声名鹊起。他是位学识渊博、品格高尚、值得信赖的人。他与公司长年的关系以及其文学素养，吸引了全国各地的一流文士聚集其门下，而他在商界的广泛联系，也让他结识了不少大商人和资本家。正是通过他，才促成了那篇悼文与那份通告的撰写；也是他将我介绍给中国著名数学家李仁树先生，后者又将我推荐给著名将领兼政治家曾国藩，正是这位曾大人后来推动了中国的留学生教育计划。人世间的因缘错综复杂，谁会成为牵引你命运之线的人，实在难以预料。曾纪富介绍我认识了李仁树，李仁树又引荐我给曾国藩，而曾国藩最终通过留学生计划，将西方教育嫁接到中国文化之上，此举注定成为将世界各族融合成兄弟之邦的伟大开端。

后来，曾纪富又将我介绍给登特洋行的总经理。该经理好意地提出让我去日本长崎担任该公司的买办，此时日本刚对外开放。我婉拒了这份职位，并坦率说明理由：虽然买办职位薪酬优厚，但其本质仍是佣仆角色。而作为耶鲁大学的毕业生，美国名校之一，我无法做出有辱母校声誉的事。我对母校怀有极深的敬意与敬仰，也极其在意她的荣誉。如果我的同学听说我在一家英商行当总佣仆（买办），他们会怎么看我？我说，人在某些境况下不得不委身低职，那无可厚非，但我尚未落到那一步，尽管我经济拮据。我宁愿为公司当内地的采购员，代表公司直接与总部联络。那样一来，我就不会牺牲自尊去换取职位上的金钱回报。我宁愿做一个按月或按件计酬的采购员，从事茶叶打包与丝绸收购工作。这就是我拒绝的理由。当然，我还是向他表示了感谢。整个面谈是在曾纪富在场时进行的，他虽不知全部细节，但英语基础尚可，大致听得出我们的交谈内容。之后我离开了，留下经理与曾先生继续交谈。曾先生事后告诉我，经理韦伯说：“容闳是个又穷又骄傲的人。穷人自尊心强，这是常有的事。”几天后，曾先生又告诉我，韦伯已决定派我去茶叶产区学习茶叶打包业务。
