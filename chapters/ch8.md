CHAPTER VIII 
EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 

The next turn I took, after leaving the 
Imperial Customs, was clerk in an English 
house tea and silk merchants. During the 
few months that I was with them, I gained quite 
an insight into mercantile business, and the 
methods of conducting it, which proved to be 
profitable knowledge and experience to me later 
on. Six months after I had entered upon my 
new sphere as a make-shift, the firm dissolved 
partnership, which once more threw me out of 
a position, and I was again cast upon the sea 
of uncertainty. But during my connection with 
the firm, two little incidents occurred which I 
must not fail to relate. 

One Thursday evening, as I was returning 
home from a prayer meeting held in the Union 
Chapel in Shanghai, I saw ahead of me on 
Szechuen Road in front of the Episcopal 
church, a string of men; each had a Chinese lan- 
tern swinging in the air over his head, and they 
were singing and shouting as they zigzagged 

67

along the road, evidently having a jolly, good 
time, while Chinese on hoth sides of the road 
were seen dodging and scampering about in 
great fright in all directions, and acting as though 
they were chased by the Old Nick himself. I 
was at a distance of about one hundred yards 
from the scene. I took in the situation at once. 
My servant, who held a lantern ahead of me, to 
light the way, was so frightened that he began 
to come back towards me. I told him not to be 
afraid, but walk right straight ahead. Pretty 
soon we confronted three or four of the fellows, 
half tipsy. One of them snatched the lantern 
from my servant and another, staggering about, 
tried to give me a kick. I walked along coolly 
and unconcerned till I reached the last batch of 
two or three fellows. I found these quite sober 
and In their senses and they were lingering be- 
hind evidently to enjoy the fun and watch the 
crowd in their hilarious antics. I stopped and 
parleyed with them, and told them who I 
was, I asked them for the names of the 
fellows who snatched my boy's lantern and of 
the fellow who tried to kick me. They deelined 
at first, but finally with the promise that I would 
not give them any trouble, they gave me the 
name of one of the fellows, his position on the 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 69 

vessel, and the name of the vessel he belonged 
to. It turned out that the man was the first 
mate of the ship "Eureka," the very vessel that 
brought me out to China, in 1855, and which 
happened to be consigned to the firm I was 
working for. The next morning, I wrote a note 
to the captain, asking him to hand the note to 
his first officer. The captain, on receiving the 
note, was quite excited, and handed it to the first 
mate, who immediately came ashore and apol- 
ogized. I made it very pleasant for him and 
told him that Americans in China were held in 
high esteem by the people, and every American 
landing in China should be jealous of the high 
estimation in which they were held and not do 
anything to compromise it. My motive in 
writing the note was merely to get him on shore 
and give him this advice. He was evidently 
pleased with my friendly attitude and extended 
his hand for a shake to thank me for the advice. 
He invited me to go on board with him to take a 
glass of wine and be good friends. I thanked 
him for his offer, but declined it, and we parted 
in an amicable way. 

My second incident, which happened a couple 
of months after the first, did not have such a 
peaceful ending. 



70 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

After the partnership of the firm, in whose 
employ I was, dissolved, an auction sale of the 
furniture of the firm took place. In the room 
where the auction was proceeding, I happened 
to be standing in a mixed crowd of Chinese 
and foreigners. A stalwart six-footer of a 
Scotchman happened to be standing behind 
me. He was not altogether a stranger to me, 
for I had met him in the streets several times. 
He began to tie a bunch of cotton balls to my 
queue, simply for a lark. But I caught him at 
it and in a pleasant way held it up and asked 
him to untie it. He folded up his arms and drew 
himself straight up with a look of the utmost 
disdain and scorn. I at once took in the situa- 
tion, and as my countenance sobered, I reiterated 
my demand to have the appendage taken off. 
All of a sudden, he thrust his fist against my 
mouth, without drawing any blood, however. 
Although he stood head and shoulders above me 
in height, yet I was not at all abashed or intimi- 
dated by his burly and contemptuous appear- 
ance. My dander was up and oblivious to all 
thoughts of our comparative size and strength, 
I struck him back in the identical place where 
he punched me, but iny blow was a stinger and 
it went with lightning rapidity to the spot* 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 71 

without giving him time to think. It drew blood 
in great profusion from lip and nose. He 
caught me by the wrist with both his hands. As 
he held my right wrist in his powerful grasp, for 
he was an athlete and a sportsman, I was just 
on the point of raising my right foot for a kick, 
which was aimed at a vital point, when the head 
partner of the firm, who happened to be near, 
suddenly stepped in between and separated us. 
I then stood off to one side, facing my antag- 
onist, who was moving off into the crowd. As I 
moved away, I was asked by a voice from the 
crowd : 

"Do you want to fight?" 

I said, "No, I was only defending myself. 
Your friend insulted me and added injury to 
insult. I took him for a gentleman, but he has 
proved himself a blackguard." 

With this stinging remark, which was heard 
all over the room, I retired from the scene into 
an adjoining room, leaving the crowd to com- 
ment on the incident. The British Consul, who 
happened to be present on the occasion, made a 
casual remark on the merits of the case and 
said, as I was told afterwards by a friend, that 
"The young man was a little too fiery; if he 
had not taken the law into his own hands, he 



72 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

could have brought suit for assault and battery 
in the consular court, but since he has already 
retaliated and his last remark before the crowd 
has inflicted a deeper cut to his antagonist than 
the blow itself, he has lost the advantage of a 
suit" 

The Scotchman, after the incident, did not 
appear in public for a whole week. I was told 
he had shut himself up in his room to give his 
wound time to heal, but the reason he did not 
care to show himself was more on account of 
being whipped by a little Chinaman in a public 
manner; for the affair, unpleasant and unfor- 
tunate as it was, created quite a sensation in the 
settlement. It was the chief topic of conversa- 
tion for a short time among foreigners, while 
among the Chinese I was looked upon with great 
respect, for since the foreign settlement on the 
extra-territorial basis was established close to 
the city of Shanghai, no Chinese within its juris- 
diction had ever been known to have the courage 
and pluck to defend his rights, point blank, when 
they had been violated or trampled upon by a 
foreigner. Their meek and mild disposition had 
allowed personal insults and affronts to pass 
unresented and unchallenged, which naturally 
had the tendency to encourage arrogance and 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 73 

insolence on the part of ignorant foreigners. 
The time will soon come, however, when the 
people of China will be so educated and enlight- 
ened as to know what their rights are, public 
and private, and to have the moral courage to 
assert and defend them whenever they are 
invaded. The triumph of Japan over Russia in 
the recent war has opened the eyes of the 
Chinese world. It will never tolerate injustice 
in any way or shape, much less will it put up 
with foreign aggression and aggrandizement 
any longer. They see now in what plight their 
national ignorance, conceit and conservatism, in 
which they had been fossilized, had placed them. 
They were on the verge of being partitioned by 
the European Powers and were saved from that 
catastrophe only by the timely intervention of the 
United States government. What the future 
will bring forth, since the Emperor Kwangsu 
and Dowager Empress Chi Hsi have both 
passed away, no one can predict. 

The breaking up of the firm by which I was 
employed, once more, as stated before, and for 
the fourth time, threw me out of a regular busi- 
ness. But I was not at all disconcerted or 
discouraged, for I had no idea of following a 
mercantile life as a permanent calling. Within 



74 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the past two years, my knowledge of the Chinese 
language had decidedly improved. I was not in 
hot haste to seek for a new position. I imme- 
diately took to translating as a means of bridg- 
ing over the breaks of a desultory life. This 
independent avocation, though not a lucrative 
one, nevertheless led the way to a wider 
acquaintance with the educated and mercantile 
classes of the Chinese; to widen my acquaintance 
was my chief concern. My translating business 
brought me in contact with the comprador of 
one of the leading houses in Shanghai. The 
senior partner of this house died in 1857. He 
was well-known and thought much of by both 
the Chinese and the foreign mercantile body. To 
attest their high regard for his memory, the 
prominent Chinese merchants drew up an elab- 
orate and eulogistic epitaph on the occasion of 
his death. The surviving members of the firm 
selected two translators to translate the epitaph. 
One was the interpreter in the British Consulate 
General, a brother to the author of "The Chinese 
and their Rebellions/' and the other was 
(through the influence of the comprador) my- 
self. To my great surprise, my translation was 
given the preference and accepted by the man- 
ager of the firm. The Chinese committee were 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 75 

quite elated that one of their countrymen knew 
enough English to bring out the inner sense of 
their epitaph. It was adopted and engraved on 
the monument. My name began to be known 
among the Chinese, not as a fighter this time, 
but as a Chinese student educated in America, 

Soon after this performance, another event 
unexpectedly came up in which I was again 
called upon to act; that was the inundation of the 
Yellow River, which had converted the northern 
part of Kiangsu province into a sea, and made 
homeless and destitute thousands of people of 
that locality. A large body of refugees had 
wandered to and flocked near Shanghai. A 
Chinese deputation, consisting of the leading 
merchants and gentry, who knew or had heard of 
me, called and asked me to draw up a circular 
appealing to the foreign community for aid and 
contributions to relieve the widespread suffering 
among the refugees. Several copies were imme- 
diately put into circulation and in less than a 
week, no less than $20,000 were subscribed and 
paid. The Chinese Committee were greatly 
elated over their success and their joy was 
unbounded. To give a finishing touch to this 
stroke of business, I wrote in the name of the 
committee a letter of acknowledgment and 



76 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

thanks to the foreign community for the prompt 
and generous contribution it had made. This 
was published in the Shanghai local papers 
"The Shanghai Mail" and "Friend of China" so 
that inside of three months after I had started 
my translating business, I had become widely 
known among the Chinese as the Chinese student 
educated in America. I was indebted to Tsang 
Kee Foo, the comprador, for being in this line 
of business, and for the fact that I was becoming 
known in Shanghai. He was a well-educated 
Chinese a man highly respected and trusted 
for his probity and intelligence. His long con- 
nection with the firm and his literary taste had 
gathered around him some of the finest Chinese 
scholars from all parts of China, while his 
business transactions brought him in touch with 
the leading Chinese capitalists and business men 
in Shanghai and elsewhere. It was through him 
that both the epitaph and the circular men- 
tioned above were written; and it was Tsang 
Kee Foo who introduced me to the celebrated 
Chinese mathematician, Li Jen Shu, who years 
afterwards brought me to the notice of Viceroy 
Tsang Kwoh Fan the distinguished general 
and statesman, who, as will be seen hereafter, 
took up and promoted the Chinese Education 



EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS 7T 

Scheme. In the great web of human affairs, it 
is almost impossible to know who among our 
friends and acquaintances may prove to be the 
right clue to unravel the skein of our destiny. 
Tsang Kee Foo introduced me to Li Jen Shu, 
the latter introduced me to Tsang Kwoh Fan, 
who finally through the Chinese Education 
Scheme grafted Western education to the Orien- 
tal culture, a union destined to weld together the 
different races of the world into one brotherhood. 
My friend Tsang Kee Foo afterwards intro- 
duced me to the head or manager of Messrs. 
Dent & Co,, who kindly offered me a position in 
his firm as comprador in Nagasaki, Japan, soon 
after that country was opened to foreign trade. 
I declined the situation, frankly and plainly 
stating my reason, which was that the com- 
pradorship, though lucrative, is associated with 
all that is menial, and that as a graduate 
of Yale, one of the leading colleges in America, 
I could not think of bringing discredit to my 
Alma Mater, for which I entertained the most 
profound respect and reverence, and was jealous 
of her proud fame. What would the college and 
my class-mates think of me, if they should hear 
that I was a comprador the head servant of 
servants in an English establishment? I said 



78 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

there were cases when a man from stress of 
circumstances may be compelled to play the part 
of a menial for a shift, but I was not yet reduced 
to that strait, though I was poor financially. I 
told him I would prefer to travel for the firm as 
its agent in the interior and correspond directly 
with the head of the firm. In that case, I would 
not sacrifice my manhood for the sake of making 
money in a position which is commonly held to 
be servile, I would much prefer to pack tea and 
buy silk as an agent either on a salary or on 
commission. Such was my ground for declining. 
I, however, thanked him for the offer. This inter- 
view took place in the presence of my friend, 
Tsang Kee Foo, who without knowing the 
details of the conversation, knew enough of the 
English language to follow the general tenor of 
the talk. I then retired and left the manager 
and my friend to talk over the result. Tsang 
afterwards told me that Webb said, "Yung 
Wing is poor but proud. Poverty and pride 
usually go together, hand in hand." A few days 
afterwards Tsang informed me that Webb had 
decided to send me to the tea districts to see and 
learn the business of packing tea.
