CHAPTER X 
MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 

In the fall of 1859 a small party of two 
missionaries, accompanied by Tsang Laisun, 
planned a trip to visit the Taiping rebels in 
Nanking. I was asked to join them, and I 
decided to do so. My object in going was to 
find out for my own satisfaction the character 
of the Taipings; whether or not they were the 
men fitted to set up a new government in the 
place of the Manchu Dynasty. Accordingly, on 
the 6th of November, 1859, we left Shanghai in 
a Woo-Sik-Kwei boat, with a stiff northeast 
breeze in our favor, though we had to stem an 
ebb tide for an hour. The weather was fine and 
the whole party was in fine spirits. We 
happened to have an American flag on board, 
and on the spur of the moment, it was flung to 
the breeze, but on a sober second thought, we had 
it hauled down so as not to attract undue atten- 
tion and have it become the means of thwarting 
the purpose of our journey. Instead of taking 
the Sung-Kiang route which was the highway 
to Suchau, we turned off into another one in 
order to avoid the possibility of being hauled 
up by the imperialists and sent back to Shang- 
hai, as we were told that an imperial fleet of 
Chinese gun-boats was at anchor at Sung 
Kiang. We found the surrounding country 
within a radius of thirty miles of Shanghai to be 
very quiet and saw no signs of political dis- 
turbance. The farmers were busily engaged in 
gathering in their rice crops. 

It might be well to mention here that during 
my sojourn in the interior, the Taiping rebels 
had captured the city of Suchau, and there was 
some apprehension on the part of foreigners in 
the settlement that they might swoop down to 
take possession of the city of Shanghai, as well 
as the foreign settlement. That was the reason 
the Sung Kiang River was picketed by Chinese 
gun-boats, and the foreign pickets were extended 
miles beyond the boundary line of the foreign 
concession. 

We reached Suchau on the morning of the 9th 
of November without meeting with any difficulty 
or obstacles all the way, nor were we challenged 
either by the imperialists or rebels, which went 
to show how loosely and negligently even in 
time of war, things were conducted in China. 

On arriving at the Lau Gate of the city, we had 
to wait at the station where tickets were issued 
to those who went into the city and taken from 
those who left, for Suchau was then under mar- 
tial law. As we wished to go into the city to see 
the commandant, in order to get letters of intro- 
duction from him to the chiefs of other cities 
along our route to Nanking, we had to send two 
of our party to headquarters to find out whether 
we were permitted to enter. At the station, close 
to the Lau Gate, we waited over an hour. 
Finally our party appeared accompanied by the 
same messenger who had been deputed by the 
head of the police to accompany them to the 
commandant's office. Permission was given us, 
and all four went in. The civil officer was 
absent, but we were introduced to the military 
commandant, Liu. He was a tall man, dressed 
in red. His affected hauteur at the start was too 
thin to disguise his want of a solid character. 
He became very inquisitive and asked the object 
of our journey to Nanking, He treated us very 
kindly, however, and gave us a letter of intro- 
duction to the commandant in Tan Yang, and 
furnished us with passports all the way through 
the cities of Woo Sik and Cheong Chow. In the 
audience hall of Commandant Liu, we were 
introduced to four foreigners two Americans, 
one Englishman, and a French noble. One of 
the Americans said he was a doctor, the English- 
man was supposed to be a military officer, and 
the Frenchman, as stated above, claimed to be 
a nobleman. Doubtless they were all ad- 
venturers. Each had his own ax to grind. One 
of the Americans had a rifle and cartridges for 
sale. He asked quite an exorbitant price for 
them and they were summarily rejected. The 
Frenchman said he had lost a fortune and had 
come out to China to make it up. Our mission- 
ary companions were much pleased after being 
entertained by Liu in hearing him recite the 
doxology, which he did glibly. Towards 
evening, when we returned to our boat, he sent 
us a number of chickens and a goat to boot. We 
were thus amply provisioned to prosecute our 
journey to Tan Yang. We left Suchau on the 
morning of the llth of November. On our 
arrival at Woo Sik, our passports were examined 
and we were very courteously treated by the 
rebels. We were invited to dinner by the chief 
in command. After that he sent us fruits and 
nuts, and came on board himself to see us off. 
We held quite a long conversation with him, 
which ended in his repeating the doxology. 

November 12th we left Woo Sik and started 
for Cheong Chow, From Suchau onward we 
were on the Grand Canal. The road on the 
bank of the canal was in good condition. Most 
of the people we saw and met were rebels, travel- 
ing between Tan Yang and Suchau, and but few 
boats were seen passing each other. All the 
country surrounding the canal between those 
cities seemed to have been abandoned by the 
peasantry and the cultivated fields were covered 
with rank grass and weeds, instead of flourishing 
crops. A traveler, not knowing the circum- 
stances, would naturally lay the blame wholly 
upon the Taiping rebels, but the imperialists 
in their conflicts with the rebels, were as culpable 
as their enemies. The rebels whom we met on 
the public road were generally very civil and 
tried in every way to protect the people in order 
to gain their confidence. Incendiarism, pillage, 
robbery and ill-treatment of the people by the 
rebels, were punished by death. We reached 
Cheong Chow in the night. We found nearly all 
the houses along the road between Woo Sik and 
Cheong Chow to be completely deserted and 
emptied of all their inmates. There were occa- 
sionally a few of the inhabitants to be seen 
standing on the bank with small baskets, 
peddling eggs, oranges and cakes, vegetables 
and pork. They were principally old people, 
with countenances showing their suffering and 
despair. On November 13, at six o'clock in the 
morning, we resumed our journey to Tan Yang. 
As we drew near Tan Yang, the people 
seemed to have regained their confidence and the 
fields seemed to be cultivated. The conduct of 
the rebels towards them was considerate and 
commendable. During the morning we saw a 
force of one thousand men marching towards 
Tan Yang. We did not quite reach Tan Yang 
and came to anchor for the night in plain sight 
of it. 

Early next morning, we went into the city to 
see the Commandant Liu, to present to him the 
letter we received in Suchau, but he was absent 
from the city. The man next to Liu, a civilian, 
came out to meet us. He was very affable and 
treated us kindly and with great civility. One 
of our party referred to the religious character 
of the Taipings. 

Chin then gave us his views of Christianity, 
as taught by Hung Siu Chune the leader of 
the rebellion. He said: 

"We worship God the Heavenly Father, with 
whom Jesus and the Holy Spirit constitute the 
true God; that Shang Ti is the True Spirit." 
He then repeated the doxology. He said the 
rebels had two doxologies the old and the new; 
they had discarded the new and adopted the old. 
He said, the Tien Wong the Celestial Emper- 
or was taken up to Heaven and received orders 
from the Heavenly Father to come and exter- 
minate all evil and rectify all wrong; to destroy 
idolatry and evil spirits, and finally to teach the 
people the knowledge of God. He did not know 
whether the Tien Wong was translated to 
Heaven hodily or in spirit, or both. He said the 
Tien Wong himself explained that he could not 
hold the same footing with God himself; that 
the homage paid to God was an act of religious 
worship, but that rendered to the Tien Wong 
was merely an act of court etiquette, which 
ministers and officers always paid to their sov- 
ereigns in every dynasty, and could not be 
construed as acts of worship. He also said that 
Tien Wong was a younger brother of Christ, but 
that it did not follow that he was born of the 
same mother. Tien Wong, he claimed, was a 
younger brother of Christ in the sense that he 
was especially appointed by God to instruct the 
people. Christ was also appointed by God to 
reform and redeem the world. With regard to 
the three cups of tea, he said that they were 
Intended as a thank-offering, and were not pro- 
pitiatory in their character. 

"Whenever we drink a cup of tea, we offer 
thanksgiving to the Heavenly Father. The 
three cups of tea have no reference to the Trinity 
whatever. One cup answers the same purpose. 
The number three was purposely chosen, because 
it is the favorite number with the Chinese, it is 
even mentioned in the Chinese classics." 

As for redemption, he said, "No sacrificial 
offering can take away our sins; the power of 
redemption is in Christ ; he redeems us and it is 
our duty to repent of our sins. Even the Tien 
Wong is very circumspect and is afraid to sin 
against God." 

In the matter of the soldiery keeping aloof 
from the people in time of war, he said, "It 
has been an immemorial custom, adopted by 
almost every dynasty, that the people should go 
to the country, and the soldiers be quartered in 
the city. When a city is captured or taken, it is 
easy to subjugate the surrounding country." 



第十章
我对太平天国的访问

1859年秋，两位传教士与曾来顺一同计划前往南京拜访太平军。我被邀请同行，并决定加入他们。我的目的是为了亲自了解太平军的本质，判断他们是否有能力取代满清王朝，建立新的政权。因此，我们于1859年11月6日从上海启程，乘坐一艘“乌锡圭”船，北风强劲，对我们航行有利，尽管起初一小时需逆流而行。天气晴朗，大家精神振奋。我们船上恰巧有一面美国国旗，一时兴起便升起了，但冷静下来一想，为避免引人注意而妨碍此次行程的目的，便又将其降下。

我们没有走通往苏州的松江大道，而选择了另一条路线，以避免被清军拦截押回上海。据说清军舰队驻扎在松江。我们发现上海方圆三十英里内的乡村都很平静，没有政治动荡的迹象。农民正忙于收割稻谷。

值得一提的是，在我进入内地期间，太平军已攻占苏州，这让租界内的外国人感到担忧，害怕太平军会突然南下，占领上海及其外国租界。因此，松江河被清军船只封锁，而外国巡逻线也延伸至租界之外数英里。

我们于11月9日上午抵达苏州，一路上既未遇困难也未受盘查，不论清军还是太平军都未拦截我们，这反映出中国即使在战时，行政管理仍极为松散与疏忽。

抵达苏州的娄门时，我们在城门旁的检查站等候——因为苏州当时实行戒严制度，进出城的人必须凭票。我们希望进入城中拜访指挥官，以便获取推荐信，介绍我们前往南京沿途各城市的太平军官员。于是，我们派两人前往总部，请求通行许可。我们在娄门外的检查站等了一个多小时。最后，我们的同伴带着一名由警察局长指派的随行使者回来，我们全体获准进城。

文官不在，但我们被介绍给军事指挥官刘。他身材高大，身穿红袍，初见时故作高傲，掩饰不住其内在的空虚。他很爱打听，询问我们前往南京的目的。不过他对我们态度亲切，给我们写了推荐信，介绍我们前往丹阳的指挥官，并为我们签发了通行证，允许我们经由吴锡与常州前往南京。

在刘指挥官的会客厅中，我们还遇到了四位外国人——两位美国人，一位英国人，以及一位法国贵族。那位美国人自称是医生，英国人似为军官，法国人则自称贵族。毫无疑问，他们都是投机者，各怀心思。

其中一位美国人带来步枪与子弹出售，索价甚高，被立即拒绝。法国人说他失去了全部财产，来中国是为了东山再起。我们的传教士同伴在听刘指挥官流利地背诵赞美诗之后，非常欣慰。当天傍晚我们返回船上时，刘指挥官送来数只鸡和一只山羊，给我们准备了充足的食物，继续前往丹阳。

我们于11月11日上午离开苏州。抵达吴锡后，太平军检查了我们的通行证，态度极为友善。主将还邀请我们共进晚餐，餐后赠送我们水果与坚果，并亲自登船送别。我们与他进行了长时间的交谈，最后他也背诵了赞美诗。

11月12日，我们离开吴锡，前往常州。从苏州起，我们沿着大运河航行。运河两岸的道路状况良好。我们所见所遇的大多是太平军人员，在丹阳与苏州之间往返，船只往来稀少。运河沿岸的乡村似乎已被农民遗弃，田地荒废，杂草丛生，毫无庄稼。若不了解背景的旅行者，可能会将一切归咎于太平军，但其实清军在与太平军交战中也同样有责任。

我们在道路上遇到的太平军大多彬彬有礼，竭力保护百姓，以获取民心。太平军对纵火、抢掠、盗窃及虐待平民的行为处以死刑。

当晚我们抵达常州，沿途大部分民居已被弃空。偶尔有些老年人站在河岸边，提着小篮子兜售鸡蛋、橘子、点心、蔬菜和猪肉，脸上满是痛苦与绝望。

11月13日早上六点，我们继续前往丹阳。临近丹阳时，发现百姓似乎恢复了信心，田地也重新开始耕种。太平军对百姓的态度可圈可点，令人称许。

当天上午，我们看到一支约一千人的队伍正向丹阳进发。当晚我们未能抵达丹阳，只能在其视线范围内抛锚过夜。

第二天一早，我们入城拜访丹阳指挥官刘，将在苏州获得的推荐信交给他。但刘不在，代为接见我们的是他的文官。此人举止温和，礼貌待人。我们一行人提及太平军的宗教性质后，他便谈起了洪秀全的基督教教义。

他这样说：
“我们崇拜上帝天父，与耶稣和圣灵合为真神；上帝（上帝，Shang Ti）是真灵。”

他接着背诵了赞美诗。他说太平军曾有两种赞美诗——新旧两本，现已弃新用旧。他还说，天王被接升天，从天父处接受命令，降世灭恶扶正，摧毁偶像与邪灵，最终教导百姓认识上帝。他不确定天王是肉体还是灵魂升天，或两者皆有。

他说天王曾明确表示，他不能与上帝同等；人们对上帝的敬拜是一种宗教仪式，而对天王的敬意只是朝廷礼仪，是历代臣民对君主应有之礼，不能视作崇拜。他还说天王是耶稣的弟弟，但并不意味着同母所生，而是指上帝特别拣选他来教化百姓；正如上帝拣选基督来拯救世界。

关于三杯茶的仪式，他解释说：“那只是感恩的象征，不具有赎罪意义。”

“每次饮茶，我们都向天父献上感恩。三杯茶与三位一体无关。一杯茶同样可以表达感恩。之所以选用三杯，是因为中国人喜爱‘三’这个数字，它在中国经典中多次出现。”

至于赎罪，他说：“献祭并不能除去我们的罪；赎罪之力在于基督；是他救赎我们，我们应当为自己的罪悔改。连天王自己都十分谨慎，不敢冒犯上帝。”

谈到战时军民分离的习俗，他说：“自古以来，历代王朝皆有此传统，即百姓避居乡间，军队驻扎城中。当城池被攻克，便容易控制周边乡村。”





The places we saw in ruins, both at Suchau 
and all the way up the canal, were partly de- 
stroyed by Cheong Yuh Leang's troops in their 
retreat, partly by local predatory parties for the 
sake of plunder, and partly by the Taipings 
themselves. When Chung Wong was in 
Suehau, he did all he could to suppress incen- 
diarism hy offering rewards of both money and 
rank to those who took an active part in sup- 
pressing it. He issued three orders: 1. That 
soldiers were not allowed to kill or slaughter the 
inhabitants. 2. They were prohibited from 
slaughtering cattle. 3* They were prohibited 
from setting fire to houses. A violation of any 
of these orders was attended with capital pun- 
ishment. When he came down to Woo Sik, he 
had a country elder decapitated for allowing 
local bandits to burn down the houses of the 
people. This was the information we gathered 
from our conversation with Chin. He also said 
that Ying Wong and Chung Wong were both 
talented men not only in military but also in 
civil affairs. 

He gave us a long account of the capture of 
different places by the rebels, and how they had 
been defeated before Nanking, when that city 
was laid siege to by the imperialists in the early 
part of 1860. He also showed us a letter by a 
chief at Hwui Chow regarding the utter defeat 
and rout of Tsang Kwoh Fan, who was hemmed 
in by an immense force of the rebels. Tsang 
was supposed to have been killed in the great 
battle. He said that Cheong Yuh Leang, the 
imperialist general, who laid siege to Nanking, 
after his defeat went to Hangchau for medical 
treatment for hemorrhage of the lungs; that all 
the country along the canal, north of the 
Yangtze, was in the hands of the rebels, and that 
Princes Chung and Ying were marching up the 
river to take possession of Hupeh, and that Shih 
Ta Kai, another chief, was assigned the conquest 
of Yun Nan, Kwai Chow and Sze Chune prov- 
inces. At that time Chin Kiang was being 
besieged by the rebels, and Chi Wong was in 
command of an army of observation in Kiang 
Nan. Such was the rambling statement given 
us by Chin regarding the disposition of the rebel 
forces under different chiefs or princes. 

After dining with him in the evening, we 
repaired to our boat for the night. The next 
morning, November 15th, we again went into the 
city and called upon Liu, but, failing to see him, 
we again called upon Chin to arrange for the 
conveyance of our luggage and ourselves from 
Tan Yang to Nanking. The aide told us to 
send all our things to Chin's office and that our 
boat, if left in Tan Yang until our return, would 
be well cared for and protected during our 
absence. So next morning, the 16th of Novem- 
ber, we started on foot and walked fifteen miles 
from Tan Yang to a village called Po Ying, 
about six miles from the city of Ku Yung, 
where we halted to pass the night. We had 
some difficulty in securing a resting place. The 
people were poor and had no confidence in 
strangers. We, however, after some coaxing, 
were supplied with straws spread out on the 
ground, and the next morning we gave the old 
women a dollar. We had boiled rice gruel, cold 
chicken and crackers for our breakfast. When 
we reached Ku Yung about nine o'clock on the 
17th of November, we found that every gate of 
the city was closed against us, as well as all 
others, because a rumor was afloat that the rebels 
before Chin Kiang were defeated, and that they 
were flocking towards Ku Yung for shelter. 
So we concluded to continue on our journey 
towards Nanking, though our missionary friends 
came near deciding to return to Tan Yang and 
wend our way back to Shanghai. We proceeded 
not far from Ku Yung, when we finally suc- 
ceeded in getting chairs and mules to prosecute 
our journey. 

On the 18th of November, after a trying and 
wearisome journey, we reached Nanking. I 
was the first one to reach the South Gate, waiting 
for the rest of the party to come up before enter- 
ing. We were reported inside of the gate and 
messengers accompanied us to the headquarters 
of the Rev. Mr. Roberts, close by the headquar- 
ters of Hung Jin, styled Prince Kan. 

After our preliminary introduction to the 
Rev. Mr. Roberts, I excused myself, and leaving 
the rest of the party to continue their conversa- 
tion with him, retired to my quarters to clean up 
and get nested from the long and tedious 
journey. In fact, I had little or nothing to say 
while in Mr. Roberts' presence, nor did I 
attempt to make myself known to him. I had 
seen him often in Macao when in Mrs. GutzlafPs 
school, twenty or more years before, and I had 
recognized him at once as soon as I set my eyes 
on him. He certainly appeared old to me, being 
dressed in his yellow satin robe of state and 
moving leisurely in his clumsy Chinese shoes. 
Exactly in what capacity he was acting in 
Nanking, I was at a loss to know; whether still 
as a religious adviser to Hung Siu Chune, 
or playing the part of secretary of state for 
the Taiping Dynasty, no one seemed able to 
teU. 

The next day (the 19th of November) I was 
invited to call on Kan Wong. He was 
a nephew of Hung Siu Chune, the rebel chief 
who was styled Tien Wong or the Celestial 
Sovereign, Before Hung Jin came to Nanking, 
I had made his acquaintance, in 1856, at Hong 
Kong* He was then connected with the London 
Mission Association as a native preacher and 
was under Dr, James Legge, the distinguished 
translator of the Chinese classics. I saw consid- 
erable of him while in Hong Kong and even 
then he had expressed a wish that he might 
see me some day in Nanking. He was then 
called Hung Jin, but since he had joined 
his uncle in Nanking, he was raised to the 
position of a prince. Kan means "Protecting," 
and Kan Wong signifies "Protecting Prince." 
He greeted me very cordially and evidently was 
glad to see me. After the usual exchange of 
conventionalities, he wanted to know what I 
thought of the Taipings ; whether I thought well 
enough of their cause to identify myself with it. 
In reply, I said I had no intention of casting 
my lot with them, but came simply to see him 
and pay my respects. At the same time, I 
wanted to find out for my own satisfaction the 
actual condition of things in Nanking. I said 
the journey from Suchau to Nanking had suggested 
several things to me, which I thought 
might be of interest to him. They were as 
follows: 

1. To organize an army on scientific 
principles. 

2. To establish a military school for the 
training of competent military officers. 

3. To establish a naval school for a navy. 

4. To organize a civil government with able 
and experienced men to act as advisers in 
the different departments of adminis- 
tration. 

5. To establish a banking system, and to 
determine on a standard of weight and 
measure. 

6. To establish an educational system of 
graded schools for the people, making the 
Bible one of the text books. 

7. To organize a system of industrial 
schools. 

These were the topics that suggested them- 
selves to me during the journey* If the Taiping 
government would be willing, I said, to adopt 
these measures and set to work to make suitable 
appropriations for them, I would be perfectly 
willing to offer my services to help carry them 
out. It was in that capacity that I felt I could 
be of the most service to the Taiping cause. In 
any other, I would simply be an encumbrance 
and a hindrance to them. 

Such was the outcome of my first interview. 
Two days later, I was again invited to call. In 
the second interview, we discussed the merits and 
the importance of the seven proposals stated in 
our first interview. Kan Wong, who had seen 
more of the outside world than the other princes 
or leaders, and even more than Hung Siu Chune 
himself, knew wherein lay the secret of the 
strength and power of the British government 
and other European powers, and fully appre- 
ciated the paramount importance and bearing 
of these proposals. But he was alone and had 
no one to back him in advocating them. The 
other princes, or leaders, were absent from the 
city, carrying on their campaign against the 
imperialists. He said he was well aware of the 
importance of these measures, but nothing could 
be done until they returned, as it required the 
consent of the majority to any measure before 
it could be carried out. 

A few days after this a small parcel was pre- 
sented to me as coming from Kan Wong. On 
opening it, I found to my great surprise a wooden 
seal about four inches long and an inch wide, 
having my name carved with the title of "E," 
which means "Righteousness," and designates 
the fourth official rank under that of a prince, 
which is the first. My title was written out on a 
piece of yellow satin stamped with the official 
seal of the Kan Wong. I was placed in a quan- 
dary and was at a loss to know its purport, 
whether it was intended to detain me in Nanking 
for good or to commit me irretrievably to the 
Taiping cause, nolens volens. At all events, I 
had not been consulted in the matter and Kan 
Wong had evidently acted on his own responsi- 
bility and taken it for granted that by conferring 
on me such a high rank as the fourth in the 
official scale of the Taipings, I might be induced 
to accept and thus identify myself with the 
Taiping cause of the final success of which I had 
strong doubts, judging from the conduct, char- 
acter and policy of the leading men connected 
with it, I talked the matter over with my asso- 
ciates, and came to the decision that I must 
forthwith return the seal and decline the tempt- 
ing bauble. I went in person to thank Kan 
Wong for this distinguished mark of his high 
consideration, and told him that at any time 
when the leaders of the Taipings decided to 
carry out either one or all of my suggestions, 
made in my first interview with him, I should 
be most happy to serve them, if my services were 
needed to help in the matter. I then asked him 
as a special favor for a passport that would*guar- 
antee me a safe conduct in traveling through the 
territory under the jurisdiction of the Taipings, 
whether on business or pleasure. The passport 
was issued to me the next day, on the 24th of 
December, and we were furnished with proper 
conveyances and provisions to take us back to 
the city of Tan Yang, where our boat lay under 
the protection of Chin, second in command of 
the city, waiting our return from Nanking. We 
started on our return trip for Shanghai on the 
27th of December by the same route as we came, 
and arrived safely in Tan Yang in the early part 
of January, 1861. 

On my way back to Shanghai, I had ample 
time to form an estimate of the Taiping Rebel- 
lion its origin, character and significance. 


我们在苏州及沿运河一路所见的废墟，部分是张玉良部队撤退时破坏的，部分是地方上的盗匪为劫掠而焚毁的，还有一部分是太平军自己造成的。忠王在苏州时，曾尽力制止纵火行为，悬赏金钱与官职奖励那些积极参与扑灭火灾的人。他发布了三条命令：一，禁止士兵杀害或屠戮百姓；二，禁止屠杀牛只；三，禁止放火焚烧房屋。违反任何一条命令者将被处以死刑。他到达吴溪县时，因一名乡绅纵容地方盗匪焚毁民房，将其斩首。这是我们从与秦交谈中得知的情况。他还说，英王与忠王二人不仅有军事才能，在政务上也颇有建树。

他向我们详述了太平军攻占各地的经过，以及他们如何在1860年初南京被清军围困时遭到惨败。他还向我们出示了一封来自徽州一位首领的信，讲述曾国藩在一次大战中被太平军重兵围困、全军溃败的情况。曾国藩在那场战役中据传已经战死。他还说，围攻南京失败后，清军将领张玉良因肺出血而前往杭州疗养；长江以北沿运河一带全已落入太平军之手，忠王与英王正沿江北上，准备占领湖北，而另一位首领石达开则被派往征服云南、贵州及四川三省。当时镇江正被太平军围困，冀王则率一支观察军驻守江南。以上是秦向我们述说的有关各位太平军首领或亲王调兵遣将的杂乱情形。

当晚我们与他共进晚餐后，便回到船上休息。次日，也就是11月15日，我们再次进城拜访刘某，但未能见到，便再次拜访秦，商讨如何将我们的行李和人从丹阳送往南京。随从告诉我们，可将所有物品送至秦的办公室存放，我们的船若留在丹阳，在我们离开期间将受到妥善看护。于是次日，即11月16日，我们徒步从丹阳出发，步行十五英里至一名为博营的村庄，距古邕城约六英里，在那里歇宿一晚。我们在寻找落脚处时颇费周折，当地百姓贫困，对外人毫无信任。我们一再劝说之后，才在地上铺了一些稻草让我们躺卧。第二天早上，我们给了老妇人一块银元，早餐是白粥、冷鸡和饼干。

11月17日上午九点左右，我们到达古邕，却发现城门对我们乃至所有人都紧闭。因为有传言称，镇江前线的太平军战败，正成群结队涌向古邕避难。于是我们决定继续前往南京，尽管我们的传教士朋友一度想返回丹阳，再回上海。我们离开古邕不远后，终于设法雇到轿子与骡子，继续旅程。

11月18日，经历一段艰苦疲惫的行程后，我们抵达南京。我是第一个抵达南门的人，在门外等候同伴到齐后才一同进入。我们在门内被通报后，由随行人员引领至罗伯茨牧师的驻所，靠近洪仁（号干王）的王府。

初次见罗伯茨牧师后，我向他致意后便自行离席，留同伴继续与他交谈，自己回房清洗，休整这段漫长而艰辛的旅程。事实上，我在他面前几乎没有开口，也未试图让他认出我。我早年在澳门葛惠良夫人的学校就读时，曾多次见过他，那是二十多年前的事，因此我一眼就认出了他。他看上去确实老了，穿着黄色缎面官袍，脚踏笨重的中式布鞋，步履缓慢。他在南京究竟担任什么职务，我不得而知——是洪秀全的宗教顾问，还是太平天国的国务大臣，谁也说不清楚。

第二天，即11月19日，我受邀拜见干王。他是太平军首领洪秀全的侄子，号称“天王”。洪仁（即干王）尚未来南京时，我于1856年在香港就已与他相识。当时他是伦敦传道会的本地传教士，受教于著名汉学家理雅各博士。我在香港时常与他往来，他当时便曾表达希望有朝一日在南京再会之愿。那时他还称洪仁，自从投奔叔父来到南京后，便被封为亲王。“干”意为“保护”，干王即“护国王”之意。他热情接待我，显然十分高兴见到我。寒暄之后，他询问我对太平天国的看法，是否有意加入他们的事业。我答道，我此行并非为了投靠，而只是来见他一面并表达敬意。同时，我也想亲自了解南京的实际状况。我说，从苏州到南京这段旅程，使我心中萌生了几个对他可能有益的建议：
1. 以科学原则组建军队；
2. 建立军事学校，培养合格的军官；
3. 建立海军学校，为建立海军做准备；
4. 组织文官政府，聘请有能力有经验之人担任各行政部门顾问；
5. 建立银行体系，并确定统一的度量衡标准；
6. 建立分级教育体系，使圣经成为教材之一；
7. 建立实业学校体系。

这些是我在旅途中想到的建议。如果太平政府愿意采纳这些举措，并为此划拨适当经费，我将非常乐意效劳，以协助这些计划的实施。我觉得唯有在此种身份下，我才能为太平事业提供最大帮助，否则只会成为他们的负担与障碍。

这便是我首次会面的结果。两天后，我再次受邀拜见。在第二次会面中，我们讨论了我首次提出的七项建议的价值与重要性。干王见多识广，所见超过其他亲王或首领，甚至超过洪秀全本人，他深知英国及其他欧洲列强的强盛之本，因此他完全理解这些建议的极端重要性。但他孤掌难鸣，在朝诸王皆不在，外出领兵作战。他说，他固然清楚这些措施的重要意义，但在诸王返回前无法实行，任何举措皆须多数同意方能推行。

几天后，我收到一件干王赠送的小包裹。打开后，大为惊讶，竟是一方木质印章，长约四英寸、宽一英寸，刻有我的姓名，封号为“义”，即太平天国中仅次于亲王（第一等）的第四等官阶。印信所附黄缎上书写封号，并盖有干王印玺。我顿时陷入两难，不知此举意图何在——是欲将我长留南京，还是意欲将我不由自主地捆绑于太平事业之上？无论如何，我对此并未被征询意见，干王显然是擅自决定，认为封予我如此高阶官职，便可令我感恩领受，从而自愿归附太平天国。但我对该政权的最终命运抱有严重怀疑，因其领导人的行事、品格与施政方针令我无法信服。我与同伴商议后，决定立即退还印章，拒绝这诱人的荣誉。我亲自前去感谢干王的厚意，并告知，若太平领导层有意采纳我初次提出的建议，无论一项或全部，我愿意随时助其实现。但除此之外，我无意为其效力。随后我请求他发给我一份通行证，保证我在太平管辖区内旅途中不论公务或私行皆可安全通行。12月24日，通行证发给我，并备妥车辆与食物，送我返回丹阳——我们的船仍在副将秦的看护之下，等待我们从南京返回。12月27日，我们循原路启程返回上海，并于1861年1月初安全抵达丹阳。

返程途中，我有足够时间对太平天国的起源、性质与历史意义进行深刻反思与评估。
