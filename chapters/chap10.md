CHAPTER X 
MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 

In the fall of 1859 a small party of two 
missionaries, accompanied by Tsang Laisun, 
planned a trip to visit the Taiping rebels in 
Nanking. I was asked to join them, and I 
decided to do so. My object in going was to 
find out for my own satisfaction the character 
of the Taipings; whether or not they were the 
men fitted to set up a new government in the 
place of the Manchu Dynasty. Accordingly, on 
the 6th of November, 1859, we left Shanghai in 
a Woo-Sik-Kwei boat, with a stiff northeast 
breeze in our favor, though we had to stem an 
ebb tide for an hour. The weather was fine and 
the whole party was in fine spirits. We 
happened to have an American flag on board, 
and on the spur of the moment, it was flung to 
the breeze, but on a sober second thought, we had 
it hauled down so as not to attract undue atten- 
tion and have it become the means of thwarting 
the purpose of our journey. Instead of taking 

the Sung-Kiang route which was the highway

MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 97 

to Suchau, we turned off into another one in 
order to avoid the possibility of being hauled 
up by the imperialists and sent back to Shang- 
hai, as we were told that an imperial fleet of 
Chinese gun-boats was at anchor at Sung 
Kiang. We found the surrounding country 
within a radius of thirty miles of Shanghai to be 
very quiet and saw no signs of political dis- 
turbance. The farmers were busily engaged in 
gathering in their rice crops. 

It might be well to mention here that during 
my sojourn in the interior, the Taiping rebels 
had captured the city of Suchau, and there was 
some apprehension on the part of foreigners in 
the settlement that they might swoop down to 
take possession of the city of Shanghai, as well 
as the foreign settlement. That was the reason 
the Sung Kiang River was picketed by Chinese 
gun-boats, and the foreign pickets were extended 
miles beyond the boundary line of the foreign 
concession. 

We reached Suchau on the morning of the 9th 
of November without meeting with any difficulty 
or obstacles all the way, nor were we challenged 
either by the imperialists or rebels, which went 
to show how loosely and negligently even in 
time of war, things were conducted in China. 



98 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

On arriving at the Lau Gate of the city, we had 
to wait at the station where tickets were issued 
to those who went into the city and taken from 
those who left, for Suchau was then under mar- 
tial law. As we wished to go into the city to see 
the commandant, in order to get letters of intro- 
duction from him to the chiefs of other cities 
along our route to Nanking, we had to send two 
of our party to headquarters to find out whether 
we were permitted to enter. At the station, close 
to the Lau Gate, we waited over an hour. 
Finally our party appeared accompanied by the 
same messenger who had been deputed by the 
head of the police to accompany them to the 
commandant's office. Permission was given us, 
and all four went in. The civil officer was 
absent, but we were introduced to the military 
commandant, Liu. He was a tall man, dressed 
in red. His affected hauteur at the start was too 
thin to disguise his want of a solid character. 
He became very inquisitive and asked the object 
of our journey to Nanking, He treated us very 
kindly, however, and gave us a letter of intro- 
duction to the commandant in Tan Yang, and 
furnished us with passports all the way through 
the cities of Woo Sik and Cheong Chow. In the 
audience hall of Commandant Liu, we were 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 99 

introduced to four foreigners two Americans, 
one Englishman, and a French noble. One of 
the Americans said he was a doctor, the English- 
man was supposed to be a military officer, and 
the Frenchman, as stated above, claimed to be 
a nobleman. Doubtless they were all ad- 
venturers. Each had his own ax to grind. One 
of the Americans had a rifle and cartridges for 
sale. He asked quite an exorbitant price for 
them and they were summarily rejected. The 
Frenchman said he had lost a fortune and had 
come out to China to make it up. Our mission- 
ary companions were much pleased after being 
entertained by Liu in hearing him recite the 
doxology, which he did glibly. Towards 
evening, when we returned to our boat, he sent 
us a number of chickens and a goat to boot. We 
were thus amply provisioned to prosecute our 
journey to Tan Yang. We left Suchau on the 
morning of the llth of November. On our 
arrival at Woo Sik, our passports were examined 
and we were very courteously treated by the 
rebels. We were invited to dinner by the chief 
in command. After that he sent us fruits and 
nuts, and came on board himself to see us off. 
We held quite a long conversation with him, 
which ended in his repeating the doxology. 



100 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

November 12th we left Woo Sik and started 
for Cheong Chow, From Suchau onward we 
were on the Grand Canal. The road on the 
bank of the canal was in good condition. Most 
of the people we saw and met were rebels, travel- 
ing between Tan Yang and Suchau, and but few 
boats were seen passing each other. All the 
country surrounding the canal between those 
cities seemed to have been abandoned by the 
peasantry and the cultivated fields were covered 
with rank grass and weeds, instead of flourishing 
crops. A traveler, not knowing the circum- 
stances, would naturally lay the blame wholly 
upon the Taiping rebels, but the imperialists 
in their conflicts with the rebels, were as culpable 
as their enemies. The rebels whom we met on 
the public road were generally very civil and 
tried in every way to protect the people in order 
to gain their confidence. Incendiarism, pillage, 
robbery and ill-treatment of the people by the 
rebels, were punished by death. We reached 
Cheong Chow in the night. We found nearly all 
the houses along the road between Woo Sik and 
Cheong Chow to be completely deserted and 
emptied of all their inmates. There were occa- 
sionally a few of the inhabitants to be seen 
standing on the bank with small baskets, 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 101 

peddling eggs, oranges and cakes, vegetables 
and pork. They were principally old people, 
with countenances showing their suffering and 
despair. On November 13, at six o'clock in the 
morning, we resumed our journey to Tan Yang. 
As we drew near Tan Yang, the people 
seemed to have regained their confidence and the 
fields seemed to be cultivated. The conduct of 
the rebels towards them was considerate and 
commendable. During the morning we saw a 
force of one thousand men marching towards 
Tan Yang. We did not quite reach Tan Yang 
and came to anchor for the night in plain sight 
of it. 

Early next morning, we went into the city to 
see the Commandant Liu, to present to him the 
letter we received in Suchau, but he was absent 
from the city. The man next to Liu, a civilian, 
came out to meet us. He was very affable and 
treated us kindly and with great civility. One 
of our party referred to the religious character 
of the Taipings. 

Chin then gave us his views of Christianity, 
as taught by Hung Siu Chune the leader of 
the rebellion. He said: 

"We worship God the Heavenly Father, with 
whom Jesus and the Holy Spirit constitute the 



102 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

true God; that Shang Ti is the True Spirit." 
He then repeated the doxology. He said the 
rebels had two doxologies the old and the new; 
they had discarded the new and adopted the old. 
He said, the Tien Wong the Celestial Emper- 
or was taken up to Heaven and received orders 
from the Heavenly Father to come and exter- 
minate all evil and rectify all wrong; to destroy 
idolatry and evil spirits, and finally to teach the 
people the knowledge of God. He did not know 
whether the Tien Wong was translated to 
Heaven hodily or in spirit, or both. He said the 
Tien Wong himself explained that he could not 
hold the same footing with God himself; that 
the homage paid to God was an act of religious 
worship, but that rendered to the Tien Wong 
was merely an act of court etiquette, which 
ministers and officers always paid to their sov- 
ereigns in every dynasty, and could not be 
construed as acts of worship. He also said that 
Tien Wong was a younger brother of Christ, but 
that it did not follow that he was born of the 
same mother. Tien Wong, he claimed, was a 
younger brother of Christ in the sense that he 
was especially appointed by God to instruct the 
people. Christ was also appointed by God to 
reform and redeem the world. With regard to 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 103 

the three cups of tea, he said that they were 
Intended as a thank-offering, and were not pro- 
pitiatory in their character. 

"Whenever we drink a cup of tea, we offer 
thanksgiving to the Heavenly Father. The 
three cups of tea have no reference to the Trinity 
whatever. One cup answers the same purpose. 
The number three was purposely chosen, because 
it is the favorite number with the Chinese, it is 
even mentioned in the Chinese classics." 

As for redemption, he said, "No sacrificial 
offering can take away our sins; the power of 
redemption is in Christ ; he redeems us and it is 
our duty to repent of our sins. Even the Tien 
Wong is very circumspect and is afraid to sin 
against God." 

In the matter of the soldiery keeping aloof 
from the people in time of war, he said, "It 
has been an immemorial custom, adopted by 
almost every dynasty, that the people should go 
to the country, and the soldiers be quartered in 
the city. When a city is captured or taken, it is 
easy to subjugate the surrounding country." 

The places we saw in ruins, both at Suchau 
and all the way up the canal, were partly de- 
stroyed by Cheong Yuh Leang's troops in their 
retreat, partly by local predatory parties for the 



104 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

sake of plunder, and partly by the Taipings 
themselves. When Chung Wong was in 
Suehau, he did all he could to suppress incen- 
diarism hy offering rewards of both money and 
rank to those who took an active part in sup- 
pressing it. He issued three orders: 1. That 
soldiers were not allowed to kill or slaughter the 
inhabitants. 2. They were prohibited from 
slaughtering cattle. 3* They were prohibited 
from setting fire to houses. A violation of any 
of these orders was attended with capital pun- 
ishment. When he came down to Woo Sik, he 
had a country elder decapitated for allowing 
local bandits to burn down the houses of the 
people. This was the information we gathered 
from our conversation with Chin. He also said 
that Ying Wong and Chung Wong were both 
talented men not only in military but also in 
civil affairs. 

He gave us a long account of the capture of 
different places by the rebels, and how they had 
been defeated before Nanking, when that city 
was laid siege to by the imperialists in the early 
part of 1860. He also showed us a letter by a 
chief at Hwui Chow regarding the utter defeat 
and rout of Tsang Kwoh Fan, who was hemmed 
in by an immense force of the rebels. Tsang 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 105 

was supposed to have been killed in the great 
battle. He said that Cheong Yuh Leang, the 
imperialist general, who laid siege to Nanking, 
after his defeat went to Hangchau for medical 
treatment for hemorrhage of the lungs; that all 
the country along the canal, north of the 
Yangtze, was in the hands of the rebels, and that 
Princes Chung and Ying were marching up the 
river to take possession of Hupeh, and that Shih 
Ta Kai, another chief, was assigned the conquest 
of Yun Nan, Kwai Chow and Sze Chune prov- 
inces. At that time Chin Kiang was being 
besieged by the rebels, and Chi Wong was in 
command of an army of observation in Kiang 
Nan. Such was the rambling statement given 
us by Chin regarding the disposition of the rebel 
forces under different chiefs or princes. 

After dining with him in the evening, we 
repaired to our boat for the night. The next 
morning, November 15th, we again went into the 
city and called upon Liu, but, failing to see him, 
we again called upon Chin to arrange for the 
conveyance of our luggage and ourselves from 
Tan Yang to Nanking. The aide told us to 
send all our things to Chin's office and that our 
boat, if left in Tan Yang until our return, would 
be well cared for and protected during our 



106 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

absence. So next morning, the 16th of Novem- 
ber, we started on foot and walked fifteen miles 
from Tan Yang to a village called Po Ying, 
about six miles from the city of Ku Yung, 
where we halted to pass the night. We had 
some difficulty in securing a resting place. The 
people were poor and had no confidence in 
strangers. We, however, after some coaxing, 
were supplied with straws spread out on the 
ground, and the next morning we gave the old 
women a dollar. We had boiled rice gruel, cold 
chicken and crackers for our breakfast. When 
we reached Ku Yung about nine o'clock on the 
17th of November, we found that every gate of 
the city was closed against us, as well as all 
others, because a rumor was afloat that the rebels 
before Chin Kiang were defeated, and that they 
were flocking towards Ku Yung for shelter. 
So we concluded to continue on our journey 
towards Nanking, though our missionary friends 
came near deciding to return to Tan Yang and 
wend our way back to Shanghai. We proceeded 
not far from Ku Yung, when we finally suc- 
ceeded in getting chairs and mules to prosecute 
our journey. 

On the 18th of November, after a trying and 
wearisome journey, we reached Nanking. I 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 107 

was the first one to reach the South Gate, waiting 
for the rest of the party to come up before enter- 
ing. We were reported inside of the gate and 
messengers accompanied us to the headquarters 
of the Rev. Mr. Roberts, close by the headquar- 
ters of Hung Jin, styled Prince Kan. 

After our preliminary introduction to the 
Rev. Mr. Roberts, I excused myself, and leaving 
the rest of the party to continue their conversa- 
tion with him, retired to my quarters to clean up 
and get nested from the long and tedious 
journey. In fact, I had little or nothing to say 
while in Mr. Roberts' presence, nor did I 
attempt to make myself known to him. I had 
seen him often in Macao when in Mrs. GutzlafPs 
school, twenty or more years before, and I had 
recognized him at once as soon as I set my eyes 
on him. He certainly appeared old to me, being 
dressed in his yellow satin robe of state and 
moving leisurely in his clumsy Chinese shoes. 
Exactly in what capacity he was acting in 
Nanking, I was at a loss to know; whether still 
as a religious adviser to Hung Siu Chune, 
or playing the part of secretary of state for 
the Taiping Dynasty, no one seemed able to 
teU. 

The next day (the 19th of November) I was 



108 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

invited to call on Kan Wong. He was 
a nephew of Hung Siu Chune, the rebel chief 
who was styled Tien Wong or the Celestial 
Sovereign, Before Hung Jin came to Nanking, 
I had made his acquaintance, in 1856, at Hong 
Kong* He was then connected with the London 
Mission Association as a native preacher and 
was under Dr, James Legge, the distinguished 
translator of the Chinese classics. I saw consid- 
erable of him while in Hong Kong and even 
then he had expressed a wish that he might 
see me some day in Nanking. He was then 
called Hung Jin, but since he had joined 
his uncle in Nanking, he was raised to the 
position of a prince. Kan means "Protecting," 
and Kan Wong signifies "Protecting Prince." 
He greeted me very cordially and evidently was 
glad to see me. After the usual exchange of 
conventionalities, he wanted to know what I 
thought of the Taipings ; whether I thought well 
enough of their cause to identify myself with it. 
In reply, I said I had no intention of casting 
my lot with them, but came simply to see him 
and pay my respects. At the same time, I 
wanted to find out for my own satisfaction the 
actual condition of things in Nanking. I said 
the journey from Suchau to Nanking had sug- 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 109 

gested several things to me, which I thought 
might be of interest to him. They were as 
follows: 

1. To organize an army on scientific 
principles. 

2. To establish a military school for the 
training of competent military officers. 

3. To establish a naval school for a navy. 

4. To organize a civil government with able 
and experienced men to act as advisers in 
the different departments of adminis- 
tration. 

5. To establish a banking system, and to 
determine on a standard of weight and 
measure. 

6. To establish an educational system of 
graded schools for the people, making the 
Bible one of the text books. 

7. To organize a system of industrial 
schools. 

These were the topics that suggested them- 
selves to me during the journey* If the Taiping 
government would be willing, I said, to adopt 
these measures and set to work to make suitable 
appropriations for them, I would be perfectly 
willing to offer my services to help carry them 
out. It was in that capacity that I felt I could 



110 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

be of the most service to the Taiping cause. In 
any other, I would simply be an encumbrance 
and a hindrance to them. 

Such was the outcome of my first interview. 
Two days later, I was again invited to call. In 
the second interview, we discussed the merits and 
the importance of the seven proposals stated in 
our first interview. Kan Wong, who had seen 
more of the outside world than the other princes 
or leaders, and even more than Hung Siu Chune 
himself, knew wherein lay the secret of the 
strength and power of the British government 
and other European powers, and fully appre- 
ciated the paramount importance and bearing 
of these proposals. But he was alone and had 
no one to back him in advocating them. The 
other princes, or leaders, were absent from the 
city, carrying on their campaign against the 
imperialists. He said he was well aware of the 
importance of these measures, but nothing could 
be done until they returned, as it required the 
consent of the majority to any measure before 
it could be carried out. 

A few days after this a small parcel was pre- 
sented to me as coming from Kan Wong. On 
opening it, I found to my great surprise a wooden 
seal about four inches long and an inch wide, 



MY VISIT TO THE TAIPINGS 111 
having my name carved with the title of "E," 



which means "Righteousness," and designates 
the fourth official rank under that of a prince, 
which is the first. My title was written out on a 
piece of yellow satin stamped with the official 
seal of the Kan Wong. I was placed in a quan- 
dary and was at a loss to know its purport, 
whether it was intended to detain me in Nanking 
for good or to commit me irretrievably to the 
Taiping cause, nolens volens. At all events, I 
had not been consulted in the matter and Kan 
Wong had evidently acted on his own responsi- 
bility and taken it for granted that by conferring 
on me such a high rank as the fourth in the 
official scale of the Taipings, I might be induced 
to accept and thus identify myself with the 
Taiping cause of the final success of which I had 
strong doubts, judging from the conduct, char- 
acter and policy of the leading men connected 
with it, I talked the matter over with my asso- 
ciates, and came to the decision that I must 
forthwith return the seal and decline the tempt- 
ing bauble. I went in person to thank Kan 
Wong for this distinguished mark of his high 
consideration, and told him that at any time 



112 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

when the leaders of the Taipings decided to 
carry out either one or all of my suggestions, 
made in my first interview with him, I should 
be most happy to serve them, if my services were 
needed to help in the matter. I then asked him 
as a special favor for a passport that would*guar- 
antee me a safe conduct in traveling through the 
territory under the jurisdiction of the Taipings, 
whether on business or pleasure. The passport 
was issued to me the next day, on the 24th of 
December, and we were furnished with proper 
conveyances and provisions to take us back to 
the city of Tan Yang, where our boat lay under 
the protection of Chin, second in command of 
the city, waiting our return from Nanking. We 
started on our return trip for Shanghai on the 
27th of December by the same route as we came, 
and arrived safely in Tan Yang in the early part 
of January, 1861. 

On my way back to Shanghai, I had ample 
time to form an estimate of the Taiping Rebel- 
lion its origin, character and significance.
