CHAPTER XIX 

END OF THE EDUCATIONAL 
MISSION 

In the fall of 1875 the last installment of stu- 
dents arrived. They came in charge of a new 
commissioner, Ou Ngoh Liang, two new 
Chinese teachers and a new interpreter, Kwang 
Kee Chen. These new men were appointed by 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang. I knew them in 
China, especially the new commissioner and the 
interpreter. 

These changes were made at the request of 
Chin Lan Pin, who expected soon to return to 
China on a leave of ahsence. He was going to 
take with him the old Chinese teacher, Yeh Shu 
Tung, who had rendered him great and signal 
service in his trip to Cuba on the coolie question 
the year before. Tsang Lai Sun, the old inter- 
preter, was also requested to resign and returned 
to China. These changes I had anticipated 
some time before and they did not surprise me. 

Three months after Chin Lan Pin's arrival in 

197 



198 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

Peking, word came from China that he and I 
were appointed joint Chinese ministers to Wash- 
ington, and that Yeh Shu Tung, the old Chinese 
teacher, was appointed secretary to the Chinese 
Legation. This was great news to me to be sure, 
but I did not feel ecstatic over it; on the con- 
trary, the more I reflected on it, the more I felt 
depressed. But my friends who congratulated 
me on the honor and promotion did not take in 
the whole situation as it loomed up before my 
mind in all its bearings. As far as I was con- 
cerned, I had every reason to feel grateful and 
honored, but how about my life work the 
Chinese educational mission that I had in hand 
and which needed in its present stage great 
watchfulness and care? If, as I reflected, I were 
to be removed to Washington, who was there 
left behind to look after the welfare of the stu- 
dents with the same interest that I had manifest- 
ed ? It would be like separating the father from 
his children. This would not do, so I sat down 
and wrote to the Viceroy a letter, the tenor of 
which ran somewhat as follows : I thanked him 
for the appointment which I considered to be a 
great honor for any man to receive from the 
government; and said that while I appreciated 
fully its significance, the obligations and respon- 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 199 

sibilities inseparably connected with the position 
filled me with anxious solicitude that my abilities 
and qualifications might not be equal to their 
satisfactory fulfilment. In view of such a state 
of mind, I much preferred, if I were allowed to 
have my preference in the matter, to remain in 
my present position as a commissioner of the 
Chinese mission in Hartford and to continue 
in it till the Chinese students should have finished 
their education and were ready to return to 
China to serve the State in their various capaci- 
ties. In that event I should have discharged a 
duty to "Tsang the Upright," and at the same 
time fulfilled a great duty to China. As Chin 
Lan Pin had been appointed minister at the 
same time, he would doubtless be able alone to 
meet the expectations of the government in his 
diplomatic capacity. 

The letter was written and engrossed by Yung 
Yune Foo, one of the old Chinese teachers who 
came over with the first installment of students 
at the same time Yeh Shu Tung came. In less 
than four months an answer was received which 
partially acceded to my request by making me 
an assistant or associate minister, at the same 
time allowing me to retain my position as Com- 
missioner of Education, and in that capacity, to 



00 MY LIFE IN CHINA (AND AMERICA 

exercise a general supervision over the education 
of the students. 

Chi Ngoh Liang, the new commissioner, was a 
much younger man than Chin. He was a fair 
Chinese scholar, 'but not a member of the Hanlin 
College. He was doubtless recommended by 
Chin Lan Pin* He brought his family with him, 
which consisted of his second wife and two 
children. He was a man of a quiet disposition 
and showed no inclination to meddle with settled 
conditions or to create trouble, but took rather 
a philosophical view of things; he had the good 
sense to let well enough alone. He was connect- 
ed with the mission but a short time and resigned 
in 1876. 

In 1876 Chin Lan Pin came as minister pleni- 
potentiary and brought with him among his 
numerous retinue Woo Tsze Tung, a man whom 
I knew in Shanghai even in the ? 50's. He was a 
member of the Hanlin College, but for some 
reason or other, he was never assigned to any 
government department, nor was he ever known 
to hold any kind of government office. He 
showed a decided taste for chemistry, but never 
seemed to have made any progress in it, and was 
regarded by all his friends as a crank. 
After Ou's resignation, Chin Lan Pin before 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 201 

proceeding to Washington to take up Ms official 
position as Chinese minister, strongly recom- 
mended Woo Tsze Tung to succeed Ou as com- 
missioner, to which Viceroy Li Hung Chang 
acceded without thinking of the consequences to 
follow. From this time forth the educational 
mission found an enemy who was determined to 
undermine the work of Tsang Kwoh Fan and 
Ting Yih Cheong, to both of whom Woo Tsze 
Tung was more or less hostile. Woo was a mem- 
ber of the reactionary party, which looked upon 
the Chinese Educational Commission as a move 
subversive of .the principles and theories of 
Chinese culture. This was told me by one of 
Chin's suite who held the appointment of charge 
d'affaires for Peru. The making of Woo Tsze 
Tung a commissioner plainly revealed the fact that 
Chin Lan Pin himself was at heart an uncom- 
promising Confucian and practically represent- 
ed the reactionary party with all its rigid and 
uncompromising conservatism that gnashes its 
teeth against all and every attempt put forth to 
reform the government or to improve the general 
condition of things in China. This accounts for 
the fact that in the early stages of the mission, 
I had many and bitter altercations with him on 
many things which had to be settled for good, 



MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

once and for all. Such as the school and per- 
sonal expenses of the students; their vacation 
expenses; their change of costume; their attend- 
ance at family worship; their attendance at 
Sunday School and church services; their out- 
door exercises and athletic games. These and 
other questions of a social nature came up for 
settlement. I had to stand as a kind of buffer 
between Chin and the students, and defended 
them in all their reasonable claims. It was in 
this manner that I must have incurred Chin's 
displeasure if not his utter dislike. He had 
never been out of China in his life until he came 
to this country. The only standard by which 
he measured things and men (especially stu- 
dents) was purely Chinese. The gradual but 
marked transformation of the students in their 
behavior and conduct as they grew in knowledge 
and stature under New England influence, cul- 
ture and environment produced a contrast to 
their behavior and conduct when they first set 
foot in New England that might well be strange 
and repugnant to the ideas and senses of a man 
like Chin Lan Pin, who all his life had been 
accustomed to see the springs of life, energy and 
independence, candor, ingenuity and open- 
heartedness all covered up and concealed, and 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 203 

in a great measure smothered and never allowed 
their full play. Now in New England the heavy 
weight of repression and suppression was lifted 
from the minds of these young students; they 
exulted in their freedom and leaped for joy. No 
wonder they took to athletic sports with alacrity 
and delight! 

Doubtless Chin Lan Pin when he left Hart- 
ford for good to go to Washington carried away 
with him a very poor idea of the work to which 
he was singled out and called upon to perform. 
He must have felt that his own immaculate 
Chinese training had been contaminated by com- 
ing in contact with Occidental schooling, which 
he looked upon with evident repugnance. At 
the same time the very work which he seemed to 
look upon with disgust had certainly served him 
the best turn in his life. It served to lift him out 
of his obscurity as a head clerk in the office of 
the Board of Punishment for twenty years to 
become a commissioner of the Chinese Educa- 
tional Commission, and from that post to be a 
minister plenipotentiary in Washington. It 
was the stepping stone by which he climbed to 
political prominence. He should not have kicked 
away the ladder under him after he had reached 
his dizzy elevation. He did all he could to break 



204 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

up the educational scheme by recommending Woo 
Tsze Tung to be the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, than whom he could not have had a more 
pliant and subservient tool for his purpose, as 
may be seen hereinafter. 

Woo Tsze Tung was installed commissioner 
in the fall of 1876. No sooner was he in office 
than he began to find fault with everything that 
had been done. Instead of laying those com- 
plaints before me, he clandestinely started a 
stream of misrepresentation to Peking about the 
students; how they had been mismanaged; how 
they had been indulged and petted by Commis- 
sioner Yung; how they had been allowed to 
enjoy more privileges than was good for them; 
how they imitated American students in ath- 
letics; that they played more than they studied; 
that they formed themselves into secret societies, 
both religious and political; that they ignored 
their teachers and would not listen to the advice 
of the new commissioner; that if they were 
allowed to continue to have their own way, they 
would soon lose their love of their own country, 
and on their return to China, they would be good 
for nothing or worse than nothing; that most 
of them went to church, attended Sunday 
Schools and had become Christians; that the 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 205 

sooner this educational enterprise was broken up 
and all the students recalled, the better it would 
be for China, etc., etc. 

Such malicious misrepresentations and other 
falsehoods which we knew nothing of, were kept 
up in a continuous stream from year to year by 
Woo Tsze Tung to his friends in Peking and to 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang. The Viceroy called 
my attention to Woo's accusations. I wrote 
back in reply that they were malicious fabrica- 
tions of a man who was known to have been a 
crank all his life; that it was a grand mistake to 
put such a man in a responsible position who had 
done nothing for himself or for others in his life; 
that he was only attempting to destroy the work 
of Tsang Kwoh Fan who, by projecting and 
fathering the educational mission, had the highest 
interest of China at heart; whereas Woo should 
have been relegated to a cell in an insane asylum 
or to an institution for imbeciles. I said further 
that Chin Lan Pin, who had recommended Woo 
to His Excellency as commissioner of Chinese 
Education, was a timid man by nature and 
trembled at the sight of the smallest responsibil- 
ities. He and I had not agreed in our line of 
policy in our diplomatic correspondence with the 
State Department nor had we agreed as com- 



06 MY LIFE IN CHINA |AND AMERICA 

missioners in regard to the treatment of the 
Chinese students. To illustrate his extreme dis- 
like of responsibilities : He was requested by the 
Governor to go to Cuba to find out the condition 
of the coolies in that island in 1873. He waited 
three months before he started on his journey. 
He sent Yeh Shu Tung and one of the teachers 
of the Mission accompanied by a young Ameri- 
can lawyer and an interpreter to Cuba, which 
party did the burden of the work and thus paved 
the way for Chin Lan Pin and made the work 
easy for him. All he had to do was to take a 
trip down to Cuba and return, fulfilling his mis- 
sion in a perfunctory way. The heat of the day 
and the burden of the labor were all borne by 
Yeh Shu Tung, but Chin Lan Pin gathered in 
the laurel and was made a minister plenipoten- 
tiary, while Yeh was given the appointment of a 
secretary of the legation. I mention these things 
not from any invidious motive towards Chin, but 
simply to show that often in the official and 
political world one man gets more praise and 
glory than he really deserves, while another is 
not rewarded according to his intrinsic worth. 
His Excellency was well aware that I had no axe 
to grind in making the foregoing statement. I 
further added that I much preferred not to 



END OP EDUCATIONAL MISSION 207 

accept the appointment of a minister to Wash- 
ington, but rather to remain as commissioner of 
education, for the sole purpose of carrying it 
through to its final success. And, one time in the 
heat of our altercation over a letter addressed to 
the State Department, I told Chin Lan Pin in 
plain language that I did not care a rap either 
for the appointment of an assistant minister, or 
for that matter, of a full minister, and that I 
was ready and would gladly resign at any mo- 
ment, leaving him free and independent to do as 
he pleased. 

This letter in answer to the Viceroy's note 
calling my attention to Woo's accusations gave 
the Viceroy an insight into Woo's antecedents, 
as well as into the impalpable character of Chin 
Lan Pin. Li was, of course, in the dark as to 
what the Viceroy had written to Chin Lan Pin, 
but things both in the legation and the Mission 
apparently moved on smoothly for a while, till 
some of the students were advanced enough in 
their studies for me to make application to the 
State Department for admittance to the Mili- 
tary Academy at West Point and the Naval 
Academy in Annapolis. The answer to my 
application was: "There is no room provided for 
Chinese students/* It was curt and disdainful. 



208 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

It breathed the spirit of Kearnyism and Sand- 
lotism with which the whole Pacific atmosphere 
was impregnated, and which had hypnotized all 
the departments of the government, especially 
Congress, in which Elaine figured most conspic- 
uously as the champion against the Chinese on 
the floor of the Senate. He had the presiden- 
tial bee buzzing in his bonnet at the time, and did 
his best to cater for the electoral votes of the 
Pacific coast. The race prejudice against the 
Chinese was so rampant and rank that not only 
my application for the students to gain entrance 
to Annapolis and West Point was treated with 
cold indifference and scornful hauteur, but the 
Burlingame Treaty of 1868 was, without the least 
provocation, and contrary to all diplomatic 
precedents and common decency, trampled under 
foot unceremoniously and wantonly, and set aside 
as though no such treaty had ever existed, in or- 
der to make way for those acts of congressional 
discrimination against Chinese immigration 
which were pressed for immediate enactment. 

When I wrote to the Viceroy that I had met 
with a rebuff in my attempt to have some of the 
students admitted to West Point and Annapolis, 
his reply at once convinced me that the fate of 
the Mission was sealed. He too fell back on the 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 209 

Burlingame Treaty of 1868 to convince me that 
the United States government had violated the 
treaty by shutting out our students from West 
Point and Annapolis. 

Having given a sketch of the progress of the 
Chinese Educational Mission from 1870 to 1877- 
8, my letter applying for their admittance into 
the Military and Naval Academies might be re- 
garded as my last official act as a commissioner, 
My duties from 1878 onwards were chiefly con- 
fined to legation work. 

When the news that my application for the 
students to enter the Military and Naval Acad- 
emies of the government had proved a failure, 
and the displeasure and disappointment of the 
Viceroy at the rebuff were known, Commissioner 
Woo once more renewed his efforts to break up 
the Mission. This time he had the secret co- 
operation of Chin Lan Pin. Misrepresentations 
and falsehoods manufactured out of the whole 
cloth went forth to Peking in renewed budgets 
in every mail, till a censor from the ranks of 
the reactionary party came forward and took 
advantage of the strong anti-Chinese prejudices 
in America to memorialize the government to 
break up the Mission and have all the students 
recalled. 



210 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

The government before acceding to the me- 
morial put the question to Viceroy Li Hung 
Chang first, who, instead of standing up for the 
students, yielded to the opposition of the reac- 
tionary party and gave his assent to have the 
students recalled. Chin Lan Pin, who from his 
personal experience was supposed to know what 
ought to be done, was the next man asked to 
give his opinion. He decided that the students 
had been in the United States long enough, and 
that it was time for them to return to China. 
Woo Tsze Tung, the Commissioner, when asked 
for his opinion, came out point blank and said 
that they should be recalled without delay and 
should be strictly watched after their return. I 
was ruled out of the consultation altogether as 
being one utterly incompetent to give an impar- 
tial and reliable opinion on the subject. Thus 
the fate of the educational mission was sealed, 
and all students, about one hundred in all, re- 
turned to China in 1881. 

The breaking up of the Chinese Educational 
Commission and the recall of the young students 
in 1881, was not brought about without a strenu- 
ous effort on the part of some thoughtful men 
who had watched steadfastly over the develop- 
ment of human progress in the East and the 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 211 

West, who came forward in their quiet and mod- 
est ways to enter a protest against the revocation 
of the Mission. Chief among them were my life- 
long friend, the Rev. J. H. Twichell, and Rev, 
John W. Lane, through whose persistent efforts 
Presidents Porter and Seelye, Samuel Clemens, 
T. F. Frelinghuysen, John Russell Young and 
others were enlisted and brought forward to stay 
the work of retrogression of the part of the 
Chinese. The protest was couched in the most 
dignified, frank and manly language of President 
Porter of Yale and read as follows : 

To The Tsung Li Yamun 

or 
Office for Foreign Affairs. 

"The undersigned, who have been instructors, 
guardians and friends of the students who were 
sent to this country under the care of the Chinese 
Educational Commission, beg leave to represent: 

"That they exceedingly regret that these 
young men have been withdrawn from the coun- 
try, and that the Educational Commission has 
been dissolved. 

"So far as we have had opportunity to observe, 
and can learn from the representations of others, 



212 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

the young men have generally made a faithful 
use of their opportunities, and have made good 
progress in the studies assigned to them, and in 
the knowledge of the language, ideas, arts and 
institutions of the people of this country. 

"With scarcely a single exception, their morals 
have been good; their manners have been singu- 
larly polite and decorous, and their behavior has 
been such as to make friends for themselves and 
their country in the families, the schools, the 
cities and villages in which they have resided. 

"In these ways they have proved themselves 
eminently worthy of the confidence which has 
been reposed in them to represent their families 
and the great Chinese Empire in a land of 
strangers. Though children and youths, they 
have seemed always to understand that the honor 
of their race and their nation was committed to 
their keeping. As the result of their good con- 
duct, many of the prejudices of ignorant and 
wicked men towards the Chinese have been 
removed, and more favorable sentiments have 
taken their place* 

"We deeply regret that the young men have 
been taken away just at the time when they were 
about to reap the most important advantages 
from their previous studies, and to gather in the 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 213 

rich harvest which their painful and laborious 
industry had been preparing for them to reap. 
The studies which most of them have pursued 
hitherto have been disciplinary and preparatory. 
The studies of which they have been deprived by 
their removal, would have been the bright flower 
and the ripened fruit of the roots and stems 
which have been slowly reared under patient 
watering and tillage. We have given to them 
the same knowledge and culture that we give to 
our own children and citizens. 

"As instructors and guardians of these young 
men, we should have welcomed to our schools 
and colleges the Commissioners of Education or 
their representatives and have explained to them 
our system and methods of instruction. In some 
cases, they have been invited to visit us, but have 
failed to respond to their invitations in person 
or by their deputies. 

"We would remind your honorable body that 
these students were originally received to our 
homes and our colleges by request of the Chinese 
government through the Secretary of State 
with the express desire that they might learn our 
language, our manners, our sciences and our 
arts. To remove them permanently and sud- 
denly without formal notice or inquiry on the 



214 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

ground that as yet they had learned nothing use- 
ful to China when their education in Western 
institutions, arts and sciences is as yet incom- 
plete, seems to us as unworthy of the great Em- 
pire for which we wish eminent prosperity and 
peace, as it is discourteous to the nation that 
extended to these young men its friendly hos- 
pitality. 

"We cannot accept as true the representation 
that they have derived evil and not good from 
our institutions, our principles and our manners. 
If they have neglected or forgotten their native 
language, we never assumed the duty of in- 
structing them in it, and cannot he held respon- 
sible for this neglect. The Chinese government 
thought it wise that some of its own youth should 
be trained after our methods. We have not 
finished the work which we were expected to 
perform. May we not reasonably be displeased 
that the results of our work should be judged 
unfavorably before it could possibly be finished? 

"In view of these considerations, and especial- 
ly in view of the injury and loss which have 
fallen upon the young men whom we have 
learned to respect and love, and the reproach 
which has implicitly been brought upon our- 
selves and the great nation to which we belong, 



END OF EDUCATIONAL MISSION 215 

we would respectfully urge that the reasons for 
this sudden decision should be reconsidered, and 
the representations which have heen made con- 
cerning the intellectual and moral character of 
our education should be properly substantiated. 
We would suggest that to this end, a committee 
may be appointed of eminent Chinese citizens 
whose duty it shall be to examine into the truth 
of the statements unfavorable to the young men 
or their teachers, which have led to the unexpect- 
ed abandonment of the Educational Commission 
and to the withdrawal of the young men from 
the United States before their education could 
be finished."
