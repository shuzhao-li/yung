CHAPTER XIX 

END OF THE EDUCATIONAL 
MISSION 

In the fall of 1875 the last installment of stu- 
dents arrived. They came in charge of a new 
commissioner, Ou Ngoh Liang, two new 
Chinese teachers and a new interpreter, Kwang 
Kee Chen. These new men were appointed by 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang. I knew them in 
China, especially the new commissioner and the 
interpreter. 

These changes were made at the request of 
Chin Lan Pin, who expected soon to return to 
China on a leave of ahsence. He was going to 
take with him the old Chinese teacher, Yeh Shu 
Tung, who had rendered him great and signal 
service in his trip to Cuba on the coolie question 
the year before. Tsang Lai Sun, the old inter- 
preter, was also requested to resign and returned 
to China. These changes I had anticipated 
some time before and they did not surprise me. 

Three months after Chin Lan Pin's arrival in 
Peking, word came from China that he and I 
were appointed joint Chinese ministers to Wash- 
ington, and that Yeh Shu Tung, the old Chinese 
teacher, was appointed secretary to the Chinese 
Legation. This was great news to me to be sure, 
but I did not feel ecstatic over it; on the con- 
trary, the more I reflected on it, the more I felt 
depressed. But my friends who congratulated 
me on the honor and promotion did not take in 
the whole situation as it loomed up before my 
mind in all its bearings. As far as I was con- 
cerned, I had every reason to feel grateful and 
honored, but how about my life work the 
Chinese educational mission that I had in hand 
and which needed in its present stage great 
watchfulness and care? If, as I reflected, I were 
to be removed to Washington, who was there 
left behind to look after the welfare of the stu- 
dents with the same interest that I had manifest- 
ed ? It would be like separating the father from 
his children. This would not do, so I sat down 
and wrote to the Viceroy a letter, the tenor of 
which ran somewhat as follows : I thanked him 
for the appointment which I considered to be a 
great honor for any man to receive from the 
government; and said that while I appreciated 
fully its significance, the obligations and responsibilities 
inseparably connected with the position 
filled me with anxious solicitude that my abilities 
and qualifications might not be equal to their 
satisfactory fulfilment. In view of such a state 
of mind, I much preferred, if I were allowed to 
have my preference in the matter, to remain in 
my present position as a commissioner of the 
Chinese mission in Hartford and to continue 
in it till the Chinese students should have finished 
their education and were ready to return to 
China to serve the State in their various capaci- 
ties. In that event I should have discharged a 
duty to "Tsang the Upright," and at the same 
time fulfilled a great duty to China. As Chin 
Lan Pin had been appointed minister at the 
same time, he would doubtless be able alone to 
meet the expectations of the government in his 
diplomatic capacity. 

The letter was written and engrossed by Yung 
Yune Foo, one of the old Chinese teachers who 
came over with the first installment of students 
at the same time Yeh Shu Tung came. In less 
than four months an answer was received which 
partially acceded to my request by making me 
an assistant or associate minister, at the same 
time allowing me to retain my position as Commissioner 
of Education, and in that capacity, to 
exercise a general supervision over the education 
of the students. 

Chi Ngoh Liang, the new commissioner, was a 
much younger man than Chin. He was a fair 
Chinese scholar, 'but not a member of the Hanlin 
College. He was doubtless recommended by 
Chin Lan Pin* He brought his family with him, 
which consisted of his second wife and two 
children. He was a man of a quiet disposition 
and showed no inclination to meddle with settled 
conditions or to create trouble, but took rather 
a philosophical view of things; he had the good 
sense to let well enough alone. He was connect- 
ed with the mission but a short time and resigned 
in 1876. 

In 1876 Chin Lan Pin came as minister pleni- 
potentiary and brought with him among his 
numerous retinue Woo Tsze Tung, a man whom 
I knew in Shanghai even in the ? 50's. He was a 
member of the Hanlin College, but for some 
reason or other, he was never assigned to any 
government department, nor was he ever known 
to hold any kind of government office. He 
showed a decided taste for chemistry, but never 
seemed to have made any progress in it, and was 
regarded by all his friends as a crank. 
After Ou's resignation, Chin Lan Pin before 
proceeding to Washington to take up Ms official 
position as Chinese minister, strongly recom- 
mended Woo Tsze Tung to succeed Ou as com- 
missioner, to which Viceroy Li Hung Chang 
acceded without thinking of the consequences to 
follow. From this time forth the educational 
mission found an enemy who was determined to 
undermine the work of Tsang Kwoh Fan and 
Ting Yih Cheong, to both of whom Woo Tsze 
Tung was more or less hostile. Woo was a mem- 
ber of the reactionary party, which looked upon 
the Chinese Educational Commission as a move 
subversive of .the principles and theories of 
Chinese culture. This was told me by one of 
Chin's suite who held the appointment of charge 
d'affaires for Peru. The making of Woo Tsze 
Tung a commissioner plainly revealed the fact that 
Chin Lan Pin himself was at heart an uncom- 
promising Confucian and practically represent- 
ed the reactionary party with all its rigid and 
uncompromising conservatism that gnashes its 
teeth against all and every attempt put forth to 
reform the government or to improve the general 
condition of things in China. This accounts for 
the fact that in the early stages of the mission, 
I had many and bitter altercations with him on 
many things which had to be settled for good, 
once and for all. Such as the school and per- 
sonal expenses of the students; their vacation 
expenses; their change of costume; their attend- 
ance at family worship; their attendance at 
Sunday School and church services; their out- 
door exercises and athletic games. These and 
other questions of a social nature came up for 
settlement. I had to stand as a kind of buffer 
between Chin and the students, and defended 
them in all their reasonable claims. It was in 
this manner that I must have incurred Chin's 
displeasure if not his utter dislike. He had 
never been out of China in his life until he came 
to this country. The only standard by which 
he measured things and men (especially stu- 
dents) was purely Chinese. The gradual but 
marked transformation of the students in their 
behavior and conduct as they grew in knowledge 
and stature under New England influence, cul- 
ture and environment produced a contrast to 
their behavior and conduct when they first set 
foot in New England that might well be strange 
and repugnant to the ideas and senses of a man 
like Chin Lan Pin, who all his life had been 
accustomed to see the springs of life, energy and 
independence, candor, ingenuity and open- 
heartedness all covered up and concealed, and 
in a great measure smothered and never allowed 
their full play. Now in New England the heavy 
weight of repression and suppression was lifted 
from the minds of these young students; they 
exulted in their freedom and leaped for joy. No 
wonder they took to athletic sports with alacrity 
and delight! 

Doubtless Chin Lan Pin when he left Hart- 
ford for good to go to Washington carried away 
with him a very poor idea of the work to which 
he was singled out and called upon to perform. 
He must have felt that his own immaculate 
Chinese training had been contaminated by com- 
ing in contact with Occidental schooling, which 
he looked upon with evident repugnance. At 
the same time the very work which he seemed to 
look upon with disgust had certainly served him 
the best turn in his life. It served to lift him out 
of his obscurity as a head clerk in the office of 
the Board of Punishment for twenty years to 
become a commissioner of the Chinese Educa- 
tional Commission, and from that post to be a 
minister plenipotentiary in Washington. It 
was the stepping stone by which he climbed to 
political prominence. He should not have kicked 
away the ladder under him after he had reached 
his dizzy elevation. He did all he could to break 
up the educational scheme by recommending Woo 
Tsze Tung to be the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, than whom he could not have had a more 
pliant and subservient tool for his purpose, as 
may be seen hereinafter. 

Woo Tsze Tung was installed commissioner 
in the fall of 1876. No sooner was he in office 
than he began to find fault with everything that 
had been done. Instead of laying those com- 
plaints before me, he clandestinely started a 
stream of misrepresentation to Peking about the 
students; how they had been mismanaged; how 
they had been indulged and petted by Commis- 
sioner Yung; how they had been allowed to 
enjoy more privileges than was good for them; 
how they imitated American students in ath- 
letics; that they played more than they studied; 
that they formed themselves into secret societies, 
both religious and political; that they ignored 
their teachers and would not listen to the advice 
of the new commissioner; that if they were 
allowed to continue to have their own way, they 
would soon lose their love of their own country, 
and on their return to China, they would be good 
for nothing or worse than nothing; that most 
of them went to church, attended Sunday 
Schools and had become Christians; that the 
sooner this educational enterprise was broken up 
and all the students recalled, the better it would 
be for China, etc., etc.

教育使团的终结

1875年秋，最后一批学生抵达美国。他们由新任监学官欧倪良（Ou Ngoh Liang）、两位新聘的中文教师，以及新译员陈光基（Kwang Kee Chen）带领而来。这几位新成员均由李鸿章亲自任命。我在中国时就认识他们，尤其是这位新监学官和译员。

这次人事更动是陈兰彬的建议，他当时即将请假返回中国。他打算带回原中文教师叶树棟，此人前年在处理古巴苦力事务的旅途中对他助益甚大。原译员曾来巽也被要求辞职并返回中国。这些变化我早有所料，因此并未感到意外。

陈兰彬抵达北京三个月后，中国方面传来消息，我与他一同被任命为中国驻华盛顿联合公使，而叶树棟则被任命为使馆秘书。这个消息对我而言无疑是一项巨大的荣耀，但我却并未为此欣喜若狂。相反，越是思考，我心中越感沉重。向我祝贺的朋友们并不了解这项任命在我心中的全部分量。就个人而言，我确实有理由感到荣耀和感激，但我一手主持、正值关键阶段的中国留美幼童教育事业又该如何呢？如果我调任华盛顿，又有谁能像我一样关心学生的福祉？这岂不是如同将父亲与儿女分离？我不能接受这样的结果，于是写信给李中堂，信的大意如下：

我首先感谢他对我任命的厚爱，这无疑是政府授予任何人的极大荣誉。我在信中表示，尽管我深知该职的意义与责任，但我对自己是否具备胜任该职位的能力深感忧虑。因此，若可让我表达个人意愿，我宁愿继续留任哈特福的中国留学生事务专员，直至所有学生完成学业、学成归国为国家效力。如此，我既能不负“曾大人”所托，也算是尽了对国家的一份大责。况且，既然陈兰彬亦被同时任命为公使，相信他一人即可胜任外交职责。

这封信由中文教师容云甫（Yung Yune Foo）执笔誊写。他是随第一批学生赴美的教师之一，与叶树棟同期。不到四个月，我收到答复，部分采纳了我的请求——任命我为副使，同时允许我保留教育专员职务，继续统筹留学生的教育事务。

新任监学官欧倪良年纪远较陈兰彬轻，是一位学问尚可的中文学者，但并非翰林出身，据称是陈兰彬推荐的。他随行携带妻妾及两名子女。为人性情温和，不喜干预已定事务，也不轻易制造麻烦，反而持一种较为豁达的人生态度。他明智地“多一事不如少一事”。他任期不长，于1876年便辞职离任。

1876年，陈兰彬以全权公使身份来美，随行人员众多，其中包括我早在五十年代上海就认识的吴子通（Woo Tsze Tung）。他虽是翰林出身，却一直未获任职，也未曾担任任何政府职位。他对化学颇感兴趣，却始终未有成就，被友人视为怪人。

欧倪良辞职后，陈兰彬尚未赴华盛顿履职，便极力推荐吴子通接任监学官。李鸿章未加多虑即准奏。从此，教育使团便迎来了一个立场敌对者，他决意破坏曾国藩与丁日昌所奠定的事业。吴子通是反对派成员，视中国教育使团为颠覆中华文化原则与传统的举动——这是陈兰彬随员、一位曾在秘鲁任职的临时代办告诉我的。

吴子通的任命揭示出一个事实：陈兰彬骨子里是一位顽固不化的儒家守旧派，实为反动势力的代表，其严苛、偏执的保守立场令他对一切改革努力咬牙切齿。正因如此，在教育使团早期阶段，我与他在多项事务上激烈争执，必须一劳永逸地解决。这些事务包括学生的学费与生活费用、假期安排、服装改革、是否需参加家庭礼拜、主日学和教会礼拜、以及学生的户外运动和体育活动。诸如此类的社会事务都需要一一厘清。而我往往成为学生与陈之间的缓冲者，竭力为学生争取合理权利。想必也因此，我招致陈兰彬的不悦，甚至厌恶。

陈兰彬此前从未出过国。他评判人事的唯一标准，就是传统的中国方式。学生们在新英格兰的熏陶下，逐渐在行为与风度上发生显著转变，与初抵美国时大相径庭，这对他来说，自然是难以理解、甚至厌恶的变化。毕竟，他一生所见的人性活力、独立精神、坦率与创造力都被重重压制，从未得以展现。而在新英格兰，这些压抑被解除，学生们在自由中雀跃，欢欣若狂，难怪他们对体育运动趋之若鹜！

陈兰彬最终离开哈特福前往华盛顿时，想必对他奉命所从事的这项工作并无好感。他恐怕觉得自己纯洁的儒家修养已被西方教育污染。然而，这项他鄙视的工作，正是他人生转机的关键。它使他从二十年默默无闻的刑部书吏，跃升为中国教育使团的监学官，进而成为驻美公使。是这项工作为他铺设了仕途之阶——他不应在爬上高位后就一脚踢开那架让他成功的梯子。他为破坏教育事业所做的，就是推荐吴子通出任监学官。事实将证明，他不可能找到一个更听话、更乐于配合的人选。

吴子通于1876年秋就任。一上任，他便开始对以往事务百般挑剔，但并未与我正面沟通，而是暗中不断向北京传递失实信息。他指责学生被永专员溺爱娇惯，享有过多不该有的特权；批评他们模仿美国学生玩乐过度，轻视学业；甚至声称他们秘密组织宗教与政治团体，抗拒教师教导，不听新任监学官的劝告；若放任不管，这些学生将会丧失爱国心，返国后不但无用，反而有害；又说大部分学生去教堂、上主日学，甚至已皈依基督教；因此，越早解散这项教育计划、召回所有学生，对中国越有利，诸如此类，不一而足。

留学事务所的终结

1875年秋，最后一批留学生抵美。新任委员区谔良率两名汉文教习及翻译邝其照同行，此皆李鸿章所委派。我早年在国内即与区、邝二人相熟。

此番人事更迭实因陈兰彬所请——这位即将告假回国的钦差，要带走曾协助古巴华工调查的教习叶绪东，并令旧译员曾来顺辞职归国。对此我早有预料。

陈兰彬返京三月后，突传谕旨：着陈兰彬与我同任驻美公使，叶绪超授驻美使馆参赞。友人皆来道贺，我却忧思忡忡。若调任华盛顿，百余名幼童教养重任托付何人？遂致书李鸿章，恳辞新职："虽感殊恩，自惭非才。倘蒙垂允，愿终始留美监督学业，以报曾文正公知遇，亦尽臣子本分。陈公既膺使节，必能独当一面。"

四个月后得复：准授驻美副使，仍兼留学事务。新任监督区谔良虽非翰林，然性情淡泊，不妄生事端，惜在任未久即于1876年辞职。

同年，陈兰彬携大批随员赴美就职，其中有我1850年代在沪相识的吴子登。此公虽列翰林，却从未实授官职，平日醉心化学而无所成，人多视其为怪癖之士。区氏既去，陈竟力荐吴继任监督。吴子登素与曾国藩、丁日昌不睦，实为顽固派中坚，视留学事业为离经叛道之举。据驻秘鲁代办密告，陈兰彬骨子里亦是顽固的卫道士，对幼童渐染西俗早已切齿。

回溯早期与陈氏之争端：学生服装费、假期开支、参加礼拜、户外运动等事，我常居间调停。在陈眼中，这些少年日渐活泼的举止，与儒家"重威仪、尚含蓄"的训诫格格不入。他岂知新英格兰的教育，恰如春风解冻，使少年们天性得以舒展。

可笑这位沉沦刑部二十年的老主事，全赖留学事业平步青云，竟过河拆桥。吴子登到任后，立即罗织罪名密报总署：谓学生运动嬉游荒废学业；结党入教蔑视师训；若任其放纵，归国后非但无用，且将贻害社稷云云。其居心之险恶，于下文可见。

（注："重威仪、尚含蓄"对应原文"the springs of life...concealed"的儒家行为规范；"春风解冻"意象化处理原文"the heavy weight...lifted"的比喻；末段"过河拆桥"四字格强化讽刺效果）



Such malicious misrepresentations and other 
falsehoods which we knew nothing of, were kept 
up in a continuous stream from year to year by 
Woo Tsze Tung to his friends in Peking and to 
Viceroy Li Hung Chang. The Viceroy called 
my attention to Woo's accusations. I wrote 
back in reply that they were malicious fabrica- 
tions of a man who was known to have been a 
crank all his life; that it was a grand mistake to 
put such a man in a responsible position who had 
done nothing for himself or for others in his life; 
that he was only attempting to destroy the work 
of Tsang Kwoh Fan who, by projecting and 
fathering the educational mission, had the highest 
interest of China at heart; whereas Woo should 
have been relegated to a cell in an insane asylum 
or to an institution for imbeciles. I said further 
that Chin Lan Pin, who had recommended Woo 
to His Excellency as commissioner of Chinese 
Education, was a timid man by nature and 
trembled at the sight of the smallest responsibil- 
ities. He and I had not agreed in our line of 
policy in our diplomatic correspondence with the 
State Department nor had we agreed as commissioners 
in regard to the treatment of the 
Chinese students. To illustrate his extreme dis- 
like of responsibilities : He was requested by the 
Governor to go to Cuba to find out the condition 
of the coolies in that island in 1873. He waited 
three months before he started on his journey. 
He sent Yeh Shu Tung and one of the teachers 
of the Mission accompanied by a young Ameri- 
can lawyer and an interpreter to Cuba, which 
party did the burden of the work and thus paved 
the way for Chin Lan Pin and made the work 
easy for him. All he had to do was to take a 
trip down to Cuba and return, fulfilling his mis- 
sion in a perfunctory way. The heat of the day 
and the burden of the labor were all borne by 
Yeh Shu Tung, but Chin Lan Pin gathered in 
the laurel and was made a minister plenipoten- 
tiary, while Yeh was given the appointment of a 
secretary of the legation. I mention these things 
not from any invidious motive towards Chin, but 
simply to show that often in the official and 
political world one man gets more praise and 
glory than he really deserves, while another is 
not rewarded according to his intrinsic worth. 
His Excellency was well aware that I had no axe 
to grind in making the foregoing statement. I 
further added that I much preferred not to 
accept the appointment of a minister to Wash- 
ington, but rather to remain as commissioner of 
education, for the sole purpose of carrying it 
through to its final success. And, one time in the 
heat of our altercation over a letter addressed to 
the State Department, I told Chin Lan Pin in 
plain language that I did not care a rap either 
for the appointment of an assistant minister, or 
for that matter, of a full minister, and that I 
was ready and would gladly resign at any mo- 
ment, leaving him free and independent to do as 
he pleased. 

This letter in answer to the Viceroy's note 
calling my attention to Woo's accusations gave 
the Viceroy an insight into Woo's antecedents, 
as well as into the impalpable character of Chin 
Lan Pin. Li was, of course, in the dark as to 
what the Viceroy had written to Chin Lan Pin, 
but things both in the legation and the Mission 
apparently moved on smoothly for a while, till 
some of the students were advanced enough in 
their studies for me to make application to the 
State Department for admittance to the Military 
Academy at West Point and the Naval 
Academy in Annapolis. The answer to my 
application was: "There is no room provided for 
Chinese students." It was curt and disdainful. 

It breathed the spirit of Kearnyism and Sand- 
lotism with which the whole Pacific atmosphere 
was impregnated, and which had hypnotized all 
the departments of the government, especially 
Congress, in which Elaine figured most conspic- 
uously as the champion against the Chinese on 
the floor of the Senate. He had the presiden- 
tial bee buzzing in his bonnet at the time, and did 
his best to cater for the electoral votes of the 
Pacific coast. The race prejudice against the 
Chinese was so rampant and rank that not only 
my application for the students to gain entrance 
to Annapolis and West Point was treated with 
cold indifference and scornful hauteur, but the 
Burlingame Treaty of 1868 was, without the least 
provocation, and contrary to all diplomatic 
precedents and common decency, trampled under 
foot unceremoniously and wantonly, and set aside 
as though no such treaty had ever existed, in or- 
der to make way for those acts of congressional 
discrimination against Chinese immigration 
which were pressed for immediate enactment. 

When I wrote to the Viceroy that I had met 
with a rebuff in my attempt to have some of the 
students admitted to West Point and Annapolis, 
his reply at once convinced me that the fate of 
the Mission was sealed. He too fell back on the 
Burlingame Treaty of 1868 to convince me that 
the United States government had violated the 
treaty by shutting out our students from West 
Point and Annapolis. 

Having given a sketch of the progress of the 
Chinese Educational Mission from 1870 to 1877- 
8, my letter applying for their admittance into 
the Military and Naval Academies might be re- 
garded as my last official act as a commissioner, 
My duties from 1878 onwards were chiefly con- 
fined to legation work. 

When the news that my application for the 
students to enter the Military and Naval Acad- 
emies of the government had proved a failure, 
and the displeasure and disappointment of the 
Viceroy at the rebuff were known, Commissioner 
Woo once more renewed his efforts to break up 
the Mission. This time he had the secret co- 
operation of Chin Lan Pin. Misrepresentations 
and falsehoods manufactured out of the whole 
cloth went forth to Peking in renewed budgets 
in every mail, till a censor from the ranks of 
the reactionary party came forward and took 
advantage of the strong anti-Chinese prejudices 
in America to memorialize the government to 
break up the Mission and have all the students 
recalled. 

The government before acceding to the me- 
morial put the question to Viceroy Li Hung 
Chang first, who, instead of standing up for the 
students, yielded to the opposition of the reac- 
tionary party and gave his assent to have the 
students recalled. Chin Lan Pin, who from his 
personal experience was supposed to know what 
ought to be done, was the next man asked to 
give his opinion. He decided that the students 
had been in the United States long enough, and 
that it was time for them to return to China. 
Woo Tsze Tung, the Commissioner, when asked 
for his opinion, came out point blank and said 
that they should be recalled without delay and 
should be strictly watched after their return. I 
was ruled out of the consultation altogether as 
being one utterly incompetent to give an impar- 
tial and reliable opinion on the subject. Thus 
the fate of the educational mission was sealed, 
and all students, about one hundred in all, re- 
turned to China in 1881. 

The breaking up of the Chinese Educational 
Commission and the recall of the young students 
in 1881, was not brought about without a strenu- 
ous effort on the part of some thoughtful men 
who had watched steadfastly over the develop- 
ment of human progress in the East and the 
West, who came forward in their quiet and mod- 
est ways to enter a protest against the revocation 
of the Mission. Chief among them were my life- 
long friend, the Rev. J. H. Twichell, and Rev, 
John W. Lane, through whose persistent efforts 
Presidents Porter and Seelye, Samuel Clemens, 
T. F. Frelinghuysen, John Russell Young and 
others were enlisted and brought forward to stay 
the work of retrogression of the part of the 
Chinese. The protest was couched in the most 
dignified, frank and manly language of President 
Porter of Yale and read as follows : 

To The Tsung Li Yamun 
    or 
Office for Foreign Affairs. 

"The undersigned, who have been instructors, 
guardians and friends of the students who were 
sent to this country under the care of the Chinese 
Educational Commission, beg leave to represent: 

"That they exceedingly regret that these 
young men have been withdrawn from the coun- 
try, and that the Educational Commission has 
been dissolved. 

"So far as we have had opportunity to observe, 
and can learn from the representations of others, 
the young men have generally made a faithful 
use of their opportunities, and have made good 
progress in the studies assigned to them, and in 
the knowledge of the language, ideas, arts and 
institutions of the people of this country. 

"With scarcely a single exception, their morals 
have been good; their manners have been singu- 
larly polite and decorous, and their behavior has 
been such as to make friends for themselves and 
their country in the families, the schools, the 
cities and villages in which they have resided. 

"In these ways they have proved themselves 
eminently worthy of the confidence which has 
been reposed in them to represent their families 
and the great Chinese Empire in a land of 
strangers. Though children and youths, they 
have seemed always to understand that the honor 
of their race and their nation was committed to 
their keeping. As the result of their good con- 
duct, many of the prejudices of ignorant and 
wicked men towards the Chinese have been 
removed, and more favorable sentiments have 
taken their place.

"We deeply regret that the young men have 
been taken away just at the time when they were 
about to reap the most important advantages 
from their previous studies, and to gather in the 
rich harvest which their painful and laborious 
industry had been preparing for them to reap. 
The studies which most of them have pursued 
hitherto have been disciplinary and preparatory. 
The studies of which they have been deprived by 
their removal, would have been the bright flower 
and the ripened fruit of the roots and stems 
which have been slowly reared under patient 
watering and tillage. We have given to them 
the same knowledge and culture that we give to 
our own children and citizens. 

"As instructors and guardians of these young 
men, we should have welcomed to our schools 
and colleges the Commissioners of Education or 
their representatives and have explained to them 
our system and methods of instruction. In some 
cases, they have been invited to visit us, but have 
failed to respond to their invitations in person 
or by their deputies. 

"We would remind your honorable body that 
these students were originally received to our 
homes and our colleges by request of the Chinese 
government through the Secretary of State 
with the express desire that they might learn our 
language, our manners, our sciences and our 
arts. To remove them permanently and sud- 
denly without formal notice or inquiry on the 
ground that as yet they had learned nothing use- 
ful to China when their education in Western 
institutions, arts and sciences is as yet incom- 
plete, seems to us as unworthy of the great Em- 
pire for which we wish eminent prosperity and 
peace, as it is discourteous to the nation that 
extended to these young men its friendly hos- 
pitality. 

"We cannot accept as true the representation 
that they have derived evil and not good from 
our institutions, our principles and our manners. 
If they have neglected or forgotten their native 
language, we never assumed the duty of in- 
structing them in it, and cannot he held respon- 
sible for this neglect. The Chinese government 
thought it wise that some of its own youth should 
be trained after our methods. We have not 
finished the work which we were expected to 
perform. May we not reasonably be displeased 
that the results of our work should be judged 
unfavorably before it could possibly be finished? 

"In view of these considerations, and especial- 
ly in view of the injury and loss which have 
fallen upon the young men whom we have 
learned to respect and love, and the reproach 
which has implicitly been brought upon our- 
selves and the great nation to which we belong, 
we would respectfully urge that the reasons for 
this sudden decision should be reconsidered, and 
the representations which have heen made con- 
cerning the intellectual and moral character of 
our education should be properly substantiated. 
We would suggest that to this end, a committee 
may be appointed of eminent Chinese citizens 
whose duty it shall be to examine into the truth 
of the statements unfavorable to the young men 
or their teachers, which have led to the unexpect- 
ed abandonment of the Educational Commission 
and to the withdrawal of the young men from 
the United States before their education could 
be finished." 


吴子彤年复一年地向他在北京的朋友以及李鸿章总督散布这种恶意的歪曲和其他我们毫不知情的谎言。李中堂曾就吴的指控向我提出质询。我写信回复称，这些都是一个终生被视为怪人的人所恶意捏造的。他一生既未为自己也未为他人做出任何贡献，把这样的人置于负有责任的职位上实属大错特错。他之所图，不过是要破坏曾国藩的心血成果。正是曾国藩提出并倡导了这项教育使命，以国家前途为己任；而吴这种人理应被关进精神病院或痴呆人士的收容机构。我还进一步指出，向大人您推荐吴担任中国教育事务专员的陈兰彬，生性怯懦，面对最小的责任都会心惊胆战。

我与他在处理对美外交函件的政策上始终意见不合，我们在处理留学生事务上也意见分歧。为了说明他对责任的极度回避：1873年，清廷命他前往古巴考察当地华工的状况。他足足拖了三个月才动身。他派叶书通及一位教育使团的老师，再加上一位美国年轻律师和一位翻译先行前往古巴，这几人承担了全部实质性的工作，也为陈兰彬铺平了道路。他只需走一趟古巴便草草了事，形式上完成了使命。正午的酷热和劳作的重担皆由叶书通承受，而陈兰彬却摘取了荣誉桂冠，被任命为全权公使，叶仅获公使馆书记一职。我提及此事并非出于对陈的恶意，而是要说明：在官场政界，一个人往往获得远超其应得的赞誉，而另一个人却得不到应有的肯定。大人您也深知我此言并非别有用心。

我还补充说，我宁愿继续担任教育专员以贯彻教育使命至成功，也不愿接受出使华盛顿的公使任命。一次，我与陈兰彬就致美国国务院的一封信争执激烈，我当面直言：我对什么副使，乃至正使的职位毫无兴趣，随时愿意辞职，将事务完全交由他独立处理。

我写给李中堂的这封信，作为对吴子彤指控的回应，不仅让他了解吴的过往，也使他看清了陈兰彬虚无飘渺的性格。尽管不清楚李中堂是否将我的信件转呈给陈兰彬，但使馆和教育使团的事务在当时表面上似乎一切顺利，直到有些学生学业进展显著，我向国务院提出申请，希望他们能被录取进入西点军校与安纳波利斯海军学院。国务院的回复却是：“我们没有为中国学生预留名额。”简短而轻蔑，语气中充满了当时太平洋沿岸的排华情绪，即“凯尔尼主义”与“沙地主义”的恶臭弥漫，其影响渗透至整个政府部门，尤以国会最为严重。布莱恩正是在参议院里充当反华急先锋，他那时正雄心勃勃地筹划竞选总统，为博取西海岸的选票而极力迎合反华情绪。

对华的种族偏见之严重和猖狂，不仅使我的申请遭到冷漠和傲慢地对待，连1868年《蒲安臣条约》也在毫无挑衅、全无外交惯例或基本礼仪的情况下被粗暴践踏、随意废除，似乎这条约从未存在过，只为为反华移民法案的迅速推进扫除障碍。

我写信告诉李中堂，我为学生申请进入军校和海军学院一事遭到拒绝。他的回复立刻让我意识到教育使团的命运已成定局。他也退回去引用1868年的《蒲安臣条约》来表明美国政府违约，将中国学生排除在军校之外。

至此，我回顾了自1870年至1877-78年中国教育使团的发展历程，向军校申请可算是我作为教育专员的最后一项官方行动。从1878年开始，我的职责主要转向处理使馆事务。

当申请军校被拒的消息传出，以及总督对这一打击所表现出的不满和失望成为众所周知后，吴子彤再次加紧了破坏教育使团的行动。这次他得到了陈兰彬的秘密协助。一封封满是凭空捏造的谎言再次不断寄往北京，直到一位保守派的言官趁着美国国内的强烈反华情绪上奏朝廷，建议解散教育使团并召回所有学生。

朝廷在做出决定前，先征询李鸿章的意见。他并未为学生挺身而出，而是顺应保守派压力，表示同意召回学生。接着陈兰彬被请示，他本该因亲历此事而深知其中利弊，却表示学生已在美国学习够久，是时候回国了。最后轮到专员吴子彤表态，他毫不含糊地说应立刻召回学生，并在他们回国后严加监视。而我则被完全排除在整个磋商之外，理由是我对该议题毫无判断能力，不能提供公正可靠的意见。于是，这项教育使命的命运宣告终结，所有学生——大约一百人——于1881年全部返国。

中国教育使团的解散和学生于1881年的召回，并非没有遭到有识之士的强烈反对。这些人一贯关心东西方人类文明的进步，在关键时刻以谦和、坚定的方式提出抗议。带头者是我一生的挚友牧师J.H. 特维切尔和牧师约翰·W·莱恩，正是他们坚持不懈地奔走，促使耶鲁大学校长波特、西利校长、塞缪尔·克莱门斯（即马克·吐温）、T.F. 弗里林海森、约翰·拉塞尔·杨等人发声反对中国方面的倒退决定。由波特校长撰写的抗议信，措辞庄重坦率，全文如下：

致：总理衙门

我们这些曾担任教育使团学生的老师、监护人和朋友，谨此表示：

我们对这些青年学子被撤离美国，教育使团被解散深感遗憾。

据我们观察，以及他人反馈，他们大都勤奋用功，在被分配的学业方面取得了良好进展，也对美国的语言、观念、艺术与制度有了深入理解。

他们的品行几乎无一例外地良好，举止彬彬有礼，态度端庄，他们的言行举止赢得了他们所在寄宿家庭、学校和社区居民的尊重与友谊，为自己也为中国赢得了好感。

他们深知，自己肩负着代表中华民族与帝国的责任，虽然年幼，却始终意识到所代表的民族与国家的荣誉。在他们良好行为的影响下，许多原本无知或怀恶意者的偏见得以消除，对中国人产生了更为积极的印象。

我们尤感痛惜的是，这些年轻人被带走的时机极为不当——恰逢他们即将收获多年苦读所累积成果之际。他们此前所学多属基础性与准备性科目，而他们被剥夺的课程则是前期辛劳的“花与果”。我们给予他们的教育，正如我们教导自己子女与公民那样毫无保留。

作为他们的老师与监护人，我们原本欢迎中国教育使团或其代表前来参观我们的学校与教学方法。在某些情况下，我们曾发出邀请，但他们从未亲临或派员响应。

我们谨此提醒贵部：这些学生之所以被送来，是应中国政府之请，由美国国务卿转达希望他们能学习我们的语言、风俗、科学与艺术。而今却突然、永久性地将他们召回，既未正式告知，也未调查原因，只因他们“尚未学得对中国有用的知识”就做出此举，这不仅有违我们对大清帝国所怀之善意和敬意，也显得对热情接待他们的美利坚民族极为失礼。

我们无法接受他们“从我们的制度、原则与礼仪中所获皆为有害而非有益”这样的说法。如果他们疏于学习母语，我们从未承担教授此项内容的义务，也不应被归咎其上。当初正是中国政府希望让青年人接受西方教育，如今我们的工作尚未完成，就被草率评判结果，实属令人遗憾。

基于上述考虑，尤其是这些我们所尊敬、所喜爱的青年所遭受的损失，以及此举所带来的对我们和我们国家的无端指责，我们恳请贵部重新考虑这一决定，并要求充分验证所有关于学生与教师不利言论之真伪。我们建议任命一委员会，由中国有声望之士组成，负责调查那些导致教育使团突然被解散、学生未完成学业即被召回的说法是否属实。

吴子登连年向京中顽固派私递密折，极尽诋毁之能事。李鸿章垂询时，我直言此乃"癫狂之徒的恶意构陷"——此人毕生一事无成，竟妄图摧毁曾国藩开创的百年大计，合当幽闭疯人院中。更揭陈兰彬畏葸本性：昔年查办古巴华工案，他拖延三月方启程，实际调查皆由叶绪东等完成，此人却坐收全功得授钦差。

我向中堂剖白：宁舍公使高位，惟愿终始留学事务。某次与陈兰彬争执国书措辞时，更明言"副使头衔弃如敝屣，随时可挂冠而去"。此函终使李鸿章洞悉吴、陈二人底细。

1878年，当我为优秀学生申请西点军校与安纳波利斯海军学院时，竟遭断然回绝："无中国学生名额"。此答复浸透加州排华风潮的毒氛——参议员米勒正为总统竞选煽动排华情绪，1868年《蒲安臣条约》竟被践若废纸。李鸿章闻讯后，亦援引该条约指责美方违约，然其态度已预示留学事业危在旦夕。

吴子登趁势勾结陈兰彬，变本加厉罗织罪名。适值顽固派御史以美国排华为由奏请撤局，李鸿章竟妥协附和，陈兰彬则称"留学期满当返"，吴子登更主张"速召回严加管束"。我竟被完全排除于决策之外——1881年，百名学子被迫中断学业，凄然归国。

当撤局令下，美国教育界群起抗议。耶鲁校长波特领衔致总理衙门公函，字字泣血：

"吾辈执教者谨呈：
此批青年品行端方，勤学精进，实为中美友谊之桥梁。其谦逊有礼，足令无知者消弭对华偏见。今正当学业将成之际遽然召回，犹如刈取未熟之穗，实非文明古国应有之举。

中国政府既主动遣生来学，未竟全功即斥西学无用，不惟轻率，更失邦交礼仪。若谓其荒疏汉文，此非吾辈职责；若疑染恶习，请遣大员实地查证。恳请另派公正委员会复查，勿使多年心血毁于谗言。"

（注："癫狂之徒"对应原文"crank"的贬义；"刈取未熟之穗"化用《尚书》典故；公函部分采用半文言体以存原貌）
