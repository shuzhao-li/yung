CHAPTER XVII 

THE CHINESE EDUCATIONAL 
MISSION 

Taking advantage of their presence, I seized 
the opportunity to press my educational scheme 
upon the attention of Ting Yih Chang and 
urged him to present the subject to the Board of 
Commissioners of which Tsang Kwoh Fan was 
president. I knew Ting sympathized with me in 
the scheme, and I knew, too, that Tsang Kwoh 
Fan had been well informed of it three years 
before through Governor Ting. Governor Ting 
took up the matter in dead earnest and held 
many private interviews with Tsang Kwoh Fan 
as well as with the other members of the Com- 
mission. One evening, returning to his head- 
quarters very late, he came to my room and 
awakened me and told me that Viceroy Tsang 
and the other Commissioners had unanimously 
decided to sign their names conjointly in a 
memorial to the government to adopt my four 
propositions. This piece of news was too much 

to allow me to sleep any more that night; while 

180

lying on my bed, as wakeful as an owl, I felt as 
though I were treading on clouds and walking 
in air. Two days after this stirring piece of 
news, the memorial was jointly signed with 
Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan's name heading the 
list, and was on its way to Peking by pony ex- 
press. Meanwhile, before the Board of Com- 
missioners disbanded and Viceroy Tsang took 
his departure for Nanking, it was decided that 
Chin Lan Pin, a member of the Hanlin College, 
who had served twenty years as a clerk in the 
Board of Punishment, should be recommended by 
Ting to co-operate with me in charge of the Chi- 
nese Educational Commission. The ground 
upon which Chin Lan Pin was recommended as 
a co-commissioner was that he was a Han Lin and 
a regularly educated Chinese, and the enterprise 
would not be so likely to meet with the opposi- 
tion it might have 'if I were to attempt to carry 
it out alone, because the scheme in principle and 
significance was against the Chinese theory of 
national education, and it would not have taken 
much to create a reaction to defeat the plan on 
account of the intense conservatism of the gov- 
ernment. The wisdom and the shrewd policy of 
such a move appealed to me at once, and I ac- 
cepted the suggestion with pleasure and alacrity.

So Chin Lan Pin was written to and came to 
Tientsin. The next day, after a farewell dinner 
had been accorded to the Board of Commission- 
ers before it broke up, Governor Ting intro- 
duced me to Chin Lan Pin, whom I had never 
met before and who was to be my associate in 
the educational scheme. He evidently was 
pleased to quit Peking, where he had been 
cooped up in the Board of Punishment for 
twenty years as a clerk. He had never filled a 
government position in any other capacity in his 
life, nor did he show any practical experience in 
the world of business and hard facts* In his 
habits he was very retiring, but very scholarly. 
In disposition he was kindly and pleasant, but 
very timid and afraid of responsibilities of even a 
feather's weight. 

In the winter of 1870, Tsang Kwoh Fan, after 
having settled the Tientsin imbroglio, returned 
to Nanking, his headquarters as the viceroy of 
the two Kiangs. There he received the imperial 
rescript sanctioning his joint memorial on the 
four proposals submitted through Ting Yih 
Chang for adoption by the government. He 
notified me on the subject. It was a glorious 
piece of news, and the Chinese educational project 
thus became a veritable historical fact, marking 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 183 

a new era in the annals of China. Tsang invited 
me to repair to Nanking, and during that visit 
the most important points connected with the 
mission were settled, viz.: the establishment of 
a preparatory school; the number of students to 
be selected to be sent abroad; where the money 
was to come from to support the students while 
there; the number of years they were to be al- 
lowed to remain there for their education. 

The educational commission was to consist 
of two commissioners, Chin Lan Pin and myself. 
Chin Lan Pin's duty was to see that the students 
should keep up their knowledge of Chinese while 
in America; my duty was to look after their for- 
eign education and to find suitable homes for 
them. Chin Lan Pin and myself were to look 
after their expenses conjointly. Two Chinese 
teachers were provided to keep up their studies in 
Chinese, and an interpreter was provided for the 
Commission. Yeh Shu Tung and Yung Yune 
Foo were the Chinese teachers and Tsang Lai 
Sun was the interpreter. Such was the com- 
position of the Chinese Educational Commis- 
sion. 

As to the character and selection of the 
students: the whole number to be sent abroad 
for education was one hundred and twenty; they 



184 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

were to be divided into four installments of 
thirty members each, one installment to be sent 
each year for four successive years at about the 
same time. The candidates to be selected were not 
to be younger than twelve or older than fifteen 
years of age. They were to show respectable par- 
entage or responsible and respectable guardians. 
They were required to pass a medical examina- 
tion, and an examination in their Chinese studies 
according to regulation reading and writing in 
Chinese also to pass an English examination if 
a candidate had been in an English school. All 
successful candidates were required to repair 
every day to the preparatory school, where teach- 
ers were provided to continue with their Chinese 
studies, and to begin the study of English or to 
continue with their English studies, for at least 
one year before they were to embark for the 
United States. 

Parents and guardians were required to sign 
a paper which stated that without recourse, they 
were perfectly willing to let their sons or 
proteges go abroad to be educated for a period 
of fifteen years, from the time they began their 
studies in the United States until they had 
finished, and that during the fifteen years, the 
government was not to be responsible for death 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 185 

or for any accident that might happen to any 
student. 

The government guaranteed to pay all their 
expenses while they were heing educated. It 
was to provide every installment with a Chinese 
teacher to accompany it to the United States, 
and to give each installment of students a suit- 
able outfit. Such were the requirements and the 
organization of the student corps. 

Immediately upon my return to Shanghai 
from Nanking after my long interview with the 
Viceroy, my first step was to have a preparatory 
school established in Shanghai for the accommo- 
dation of at least thirty students, which was the 
full complement for the first installment. t Liu 
Kai Sing, who was with the Viceroy for a 
number of years as his first secretary in the 
Department on Memorials, was appointed 
superintendent of the preparatory school in 
Shanghai. In him, I found an able coadjutor 
as well as a staunch friend who took a deep 
interest in the educational scheme. He it was 
who prepared all the four installments of stu- 
dents to come to this country. 

Thus the China end of the scheme was set 
afloat in the summer of 1871. To make up the 
full complement of the first installment of 



186 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

students, I had to take a trip down to Hong 
Kong to visit the English government schools to 
select from them a few bright candidates who 
had had some instruction both in English and 
Chinese studies. As the people in the northern 
part of China did not know that such an educa- 
tional scheme had been projected by the govern- 
ment, there being no Chinese newspapers pub- 
lished at that time to spread the news among 
the people, we had, at first, few applications for 
entrance into the preparatory school. All the 
applications came from the Canton people, 
especially from the district of Heang Shan. 
This accounts for the fact that nine-tenths of the 
one hundred and twenty government students 
were from the south. 

In the winter of 1871, a few months after the 
preparatory school had begun operations, China 
suffered an irreparable loss by the death of Vice- 
roy Tsang Kwoh Fan, who died in Nanking at 
the ripe age of seventy-one years. Had his life 
been spared even a year longer, he would have 
seen the first installment of thirty students start- 
ed for the United States, the first fruit of his 
own planting. But founders of all great and 
good works are not permitted by the nature and 
order of things to live beyond their ordained Mm- 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 187 

itations to witness the successful developments 
of their own labor in this world; but the conse- 
quences of human action and human character, 
when once their die is cast, will reach to eternity. 
Sufficient for Tsang Kwoh Fan that he had 
completed his share in the educational line well. 
He did a great and glorious work for China and 
posterity, and those who were privileged to reap 
the benefit of his labor will find ample reason to 
bless him as China's great benefactor. Tsang, 
as a statesman, a patriot, and as a man, towered 
above his contemporaries even as Mount Everest 
rises above the surrounding heights of the Hima- 
laya range, forever resting in undisturbed calm- 
ness and crowned with the purity of everlasting 
snow. Before he breathed his last, I was told 
that it was his wish that his successor and pro- 
tege, Li Hung Chang, be requested to take up 
his mantle and carry on the work of the Chinese 
Educational Commission. 

Li Hung Chang was of an altogether different 
make-up from his distinguished predecessor and 
patron. He was of an excitable and nervous 
temperament, capricious and impulsive, suscep- 
tible to flattery and praise, or, as the Chinese 
laconically put it, he was fond of wearing tall 
hats. His outward manners were brusque, but 



188 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

he was inwardly kind-hearted. As a statesman 
he was far inferior to Tsang; as a patriot and 
politician, his character could not stand a mo- 
ment before the searchlight of cold and impartial 
history. It was under such a man that the 
Chinese Educational Commission was launched 
forth. 

In the latter part of the summer of 1872 the 
first installment of Chinese students, thirty in 
number, were ready to start on the passage 
across the Pacific to the United States. In order 
that they might have homes to go to on their 
arrival, it devolved upon me to precede them by 
one month, leaving Chin Lan Pin, the two 
Chinese teachers and their interpreter to come on 
a mail later. After reaching New York by the 
Baltimore and Ohio, via Washington, I went as 
far as New Haven on my way to Springfield, 
Mass., where I intended to meet the students and 
other members of the commission on their way 
to the East by the Boston and Albany Railroad. 
At New Haven, the first person I called upon to 
announce my mission was Prof. James Hadley. 
He was indeed glad to see me, and was delighted 
to know that I had come back with such a mission 
in my hands. After making my wants known 
to him, he immediately recommended me to call 



CHINESE EDUCATIONAL MISSION 189 

upon Mr. B. G. Northrop, which I did, Mr. 
Northrop was then Commissioner of Education 
for Connecticut. I told him my business and 
asked his advice. He strongly recommended me 
to distribute and locate the students in New 
England families, either by twos or fours to 
each family, where they could be cared for and at 
the same time instructed, till they were able to 
join classes in graded schools. This advice I 
followed at once. I went on to Springfield, 
Mass., which city I considered was the most 
central point from which to distribute the stu- 
dents in New England; for this reason I chose 
Springfield for my headquarters. This enabled 
me to be very near my friends, Dr. A. S. 
McClean and his worthy wife, both of whom had 
been my steadfast friends since 1854. 

But through the advice of Dr. B. G. Northrop 
and other friends, I made my permanent head- 
quarters in the city of Hartford, Conn. 5 and for 
nearly two years our headquarters were located 
on Sumner Street. I did not abandon Spring- 
field, but made it the center of distribution and 
location of the students as long as they continued 
to come over, which was for three successive years, 
ending in 1875. 

In 1874, Li Hung Chang, at the recommen- 



190 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

dation of the commission, authorized me to put 
up a handsome, substantial building on Collins 
Street as the permanent headquarters of the 
Chinese Educational Commission in the United 
States. In January, 1875, we moved into our 
new headquarters, which was a large, double 
three-story house spacious enough to accommo- 
date the Commissioners, teachers and seventy- 
five students at one time. It was provided with 
a school-room where Chinese was exclusively 
taught; a dining room, a double kitchen, dormi- 
tories and bath rooms. The motive which led 
me to build permanent headquarters of our own 
was to have the educational mission as deeply 
rooted in the United States as possible, so as not 
to give the Chinese government any chance of 
retrograding in this movement. Such was my 
proposal, but that was not God's disposal as sub- 
sequent events plainly proved.
