CHAPTER XVII 

THE CHINESE EDUCATIONAL 
MISSION 

Taking advantage of their presence, I seized 
the opportunity to press my educational scheme 
upon the attention of Ting Yih Chang and 
urged him to present the subject to the Board of 
Commissioners of which Tsang Kwoh Fan was 
president. I knew Ting sympathized with me in 
the scheme, and I knew, too, that Tsang Kwoh 
Fan had been well informed of it three years 
before through Governor Ting. Governor Ting 
took up the matter in dead earnest and held 
many private interviews with Tsang Kwoh Fan 
as well as with the other members of the Com- 
mission. One evening, returning to his head- 
quarters very late, he came to my room and 
awakened me and told me that Viceroy Tsang 
and the other Commissioners had unanimously 
decided to sign their names conjointly in a 
memorial to the government to adopt my four 
propositions. This piece of news was too much 

to allow me to sleep any more that night; while 
lying on my bed, as wakeful as an owl, I felt as 
though I were treading on clouds and walking 
in air. Two days after this stirring piece of 
news, the memorial was jointly signed with 
Viceroy Tsang Kwoh Fan's name heading the 
list, and was on its way to Peking by pony ex- 
press. Meanwhile, before the Board of Com- 
missioners disbanded and Viceroy Tsang took 
his departure for Nanking, it was decided that 
Chin Lan Pin, a member of the Hanlin College, 
who had served twenty years as a clerk in the 
Board of Punishment, should be recommended by 
Ting to co-operate with me in charge of the Chi- 
nese Educational Commission. The ground 
upon which Chin Lan Pin was recommended as 
a co-commissioner was that he was a Han Lin and 
a regularly educated Chinese, and the enterprise 
would not be so likely to meet with the opposi- 
tion it might have 'if I were to attempt to carry 
it out alone, because the scheme in principle and 
significance was against the Chinese theory of 
national education, and it would not have taken 
much to create a reaction to defeat the plan on 
account of the intense conservatism of the gov- 
ernment. The wisdom and the shrewd policy of 
such a move appealed to me at once, and I ac- 
cepted the suggestion with pleasure and alacrity. 

So Chin Lan Pin was written to and came to 
Tientsin. The next day, after a farewell dinner 
had been accorded to the Board of Commission- 
ers before it broke up, Governor Ting intro- 
duced me to Chin Lan Pin, whom I had never 
met before and who was to be my associate in 
the educational scheme. He evidently was 
pleased to quit Peking, where he had been 
cooped up in the Board of Punishment for 
twenty years as a clerk. He had never filled a 
government position in any other capacity in his 
life, nor did he show any practical experience in 
the world of business and hard facts* In his 
habits he was very retiring, but very scholarly. 
In disposition he was kindly and pleasant, but 
very timid and afraid of responsibilities of even a 
feather's weight. 

In the winter of 1870, Tsang Kwoh Fan, after 
having settled the Tientsin imbroglio, returned 
to Nanking, his headquarters as the viceroy of 
the two Kiangs. There he received the imperial 
rescript sanctioning his joint memorial on the 
four proposals submitted through Ting Yih 
Chang for adoption by the government. He 
notified me on the subject. It was a glorious 
piece of news, and the Chinese educational project 
thus became a veritable historical fact, marking 
a new era in the annals of China. Tsang invited 
me to repair to Nanking, and during that visit 
the most important points connected with the 
mission were settled, viz.: the establishment of 
a preparatory school; the number of students to 
be selected to be sent abroad; where the money 
was to come from to support the students while 
there; the number of years they were to be al- 
lowed to remain there for their education. 

The educational commission was to consist 
of two commissioners, Chin Lan Pin and myself. 
Chin Lan Pin's duty was to see that the students 
should keep up their knowledge of Chinese while 
in America; my duty was to look after their for- 
eign education and to find suitable homes for 
them. Chin Lan Pin and myself were to look 
after their expenses conjointly. Two Chinese 
teachers were provided to keep up their studies in 
Chinese, and an interpreter was provided for the 
Commission. Yeh Shu Tung and Yung Yune 
Foo were the Chinese teachers and Tsang Lai 
Sun was the interpreter. Such was the com- 
position of the Chinese Educational Commis- 
sion. 

As to the character and selection of the 
students: the whole number to be sent abroad 
for education was one hundred and twenty; they 
were to be divided into four installments of 
thirty members each, one installment to be sent 
each year for four successive years at about the 
same time. The candidates to be selected were not 
to be younger than twelve or older than fifteen 
years of age. They were to show respectable par- 
entage or responsible and respectable guardians. 
They were required to pass a medical examina- 
tion, and an examination in their Chinese studies 
according to regulation reading and writing in 
Chinese also to pass an English examination if 
a candidate had been in an English school. All 
successful candidates were required to repair 
every day to the preparatory school, where teach- 
ers were provided to continue with their Chinese 
studies, and to begin the study of English or to 
continue with their English studies, for at least 
one year before they were to embark for the 
United States. 

Parents and guardians were required to sign 
a paper which stated that without recourse, they 
were perfectly willing to let their sons or 
proteges go abroad to be educated for a period 
of fifteen years, from the time they began their 
studies in the United States until they had 
finished, and that during the fifteen years, the 
government was not to be responsible for death 
or for any accident that might happen to any 
student. 

The government guaranteed to pay all their 
expenses while they were heing educated. It 
was to provide every installment with a Chinese 
teacher to accompany it to the United States, 
and to give each installment of students a suit- 
able outfit. Such were the requirements and the 
organization of the student corps. 

Immediately upon my return to Shanghai 
from Nanking after my long interview with the 
Viceroy, my first step was to have a preparatory 
school established in Shanghai for the accommo- 
dation of at least thirty students, which was the 
full complement for the first installment. t Liu 
Kai Sing, who was with the Viceroy for a 
number of years as his first secretary in the 
Department on Memorials, was appointed 
superintendent of the preparatory school in 
Shanghai. In him, I found an able coadjutor 
as well as a staunch friend who took a deep 
interest in the educational scheme. He it was 
who prepared all the four installments of stu- 
dents to come to this country. 

Thus the China end of the scheme was set 
afloat in the summer of 1871. To make up the 
full complement of the first installment of 
students, I had to take a trip down to Hong 
Kong to visit the English government schools to 
select from them a few bright candidates who 
had had some instruction both in English and 
Chinese studies. As the people in the northern 
part of China did not know that such an educa- 
tional scheme had been projected by the govern- 
ment, there being no Chinese newspapers pub- 
lished at that time to spread the news among 
the people, we had, at first, few applications for 
entrance into the preparatory school. All the 
applications came from the Canton people, 
especially from the district of Heang Shan. 
This accounts for the fact that nine-tenths of the 
one hundred and twenty government students 
were from the south. 

In the winter of 1871, a few months after the 
preparatory school had begun operations, China 
suffered an irreparable loss by the death of Vice- 
roy Tsang Kwoh Fan, who died in Nanking at 
the ripe age of seventy-one years. Had his life 
been spared even a year longer, he would have 
seen the first installment of thirty students start- 
ed for the United States, the first fruit of his 
own planting. But founders of all great and 
good works are not permitted by the nature and 
order of things to live beyond their ordained limitations 
to witness the successful developments 
of their own labor in this world; but the conse- 
quences of human action and human character, 
when once their die is cast, will reach to eternity. 
Sufficient for Tsang Kwoh Fan that he had 
completed his share in the educational line well. 
He did a great and glorious work for China and 
posterity, and those who were privileged to reap 
the benefit of his labor will find ample reason to 
bless him as China's great benefactor. Tsang, 
as a statesman, a patriot, and as a man, towered 
above his contemporaries even as Mount Everest 
rises above the surrounding heights of the Hima- 
laya range, forever resting in undisturbed calm- 
ness and crowned with the purity of everlasting 
snow. Before he breathed his last, I was told 
that it was his wish that his successor and pro- 
tege, Li Hung Chang, be requested to take up 
his mantle and carry on the work of the Chinese 
Educational Commission. 

Li Hung Chang was of an altogether different 
make-up from his distinguished predecessor and 
patron. He was of an excitable and nervous 
temperament, capricious and impulsive, suscep- 
tible to flattery and praise, or, as the Chinese 
laconically put it, he was fond of wearing tall 
hats. His outward manners were brusque, but 
he was inwardly kind-hearted. As a statesman 
he was far inferior to Tsang; as a patriot and 
politician, his character could not stand a mo- 
ment before the searchlight of cold and impartial 
history. It was under such a man that the 
Chinese Educational Commission was launched 
forth. 

In the latter part of the summer of 1872 the 
first installment of Chinese students, thirty in 
number, were ready to start on the passage 
across the Pacific to the United States. In order 
that they might have homes to go to on their 
arrival, it devolved upon me to precede them by 
one month, leaving Chin Lan Pin, the two 
Chinese teachers and their interpreter to come on 
a mail later. After reaching New York by the 
Baltimore and Ohio, via Washington, I went as 
far as New Haven on my way to Springfield, 
Mass., where I intended to meet the students and 
other members of the commission on their way 
to the East by the Boston and Albany Railroad. 
At New Haven, the first person I called upon to 
announce my mission was Prof. James Hadley. 
He was indeed glad to see me, and was delighted 
to know that I had come back with such a mission 
in my hands. After making my wants known 
to him, he immediately recommended me to call 
upon Mr. B. G. Northrop, which I did, Mr. 
Northrop was then Commissioner of Education 
for Connecticut. I told him my business and 
asked his advice. He strongly recommended me 
to distribute and locate the students in New 
England families, either by twos or fours to 
each family, where they could be cared for and at 
the same time instructed, till they were able to 
join classes in graded schools. This advice I 
followed at once. I went on to Springfield, 
Mass., which city I considered was the most 
central point from which to distribute the stu- 
dents in New England; for this reason I chose 
Springfield for my headquarters. This enabled 
me to be very near my friends, Dr. A. S. 
McClean and his worthy wife, both of whom had 
been my steadfast friends since 1854. 

But through the advice of Dr. B. G. Northrop 
and other friends, I made my permanent head- 
quarters in the city of Hartford, Conn. 5 and for 
nearly two years our headquarters were located 
on Sumner Street. I did not abandon Spring- 
field, but made it the center of distribution and 
location of the students as long as they continued 
to come over, which was for three successive years, 
ending in 1875. 

In 1874, Li Hung Chang, at the recommendation 
of the commission, authorized me to put 
up a handsome, substantial building on Collins 
Street as the permanent headquarters of the 
Chinese Educational Commission in the United 
States. In January, 1875, we moved into our 
new headquarters, which was a large, double 
three-story house spacious enough to accommo- 
date the Commissioners, teachers and seventy- 
five students at one time. It was provided with 
a school-room where Chinese was exclusively 
taught; a dining room, a double kitchen, dormi- 
tories and bath rooms. The motive which led 
me to build permanent headquarters of our own 
was to have the educational mission as deeply 
rooted in the United States as possible, so as not 
to give the Chinese government any chance of 
retrograding in this movement. Such was my 
proposal, but that was not God's disposal as sub- 
sequent events plainly proved.

中国留美教育使团

趁着他们在场的机会，我抓住时机，向丁日昌大力推进我的教育计划，并敦促他将此事提交给由曾国藩为首的总理衙门。我知道丁日昌在此事上是支持我的，也知道曾国藩早在三年前就通过丁总督了解了我的计划。丁总督对此事十分上心，多次与曾国藩及其他委员私下会谈。有一天晚上，他很晚才回到他的驻地，随即来到我房间把我叫醒，告诉我曾国藩与其他委员一致决定联名上奏，建议政府采纳我提出的四项建议。这一消息让我彻夜难眠，躺在床上，像猫头鹰一样清醒，仿佛置身云端，飘然若仙。

这激动人心的消息传来两天后，奏折便由曾国藩率先签名，诸委员联名具奏，通过驿站快马送往北京。与此同时，在总理衙门解散、曾国藩启程赴南京之前，他们决定由汉林院学士、曾在刑部任职二十年的秦缆聘与我共同负责中国留美教育事务。丁总督提议推荐秦缆聘担任教育使团的中方委员，其理由在于他是汉林出身、具正统科举背景，这样一来，此项事业就不容易因我的身份而遭受抵制。毕竟，这一计划在原则与意义上与传统中国教育理念相悖，稍有风吹草动，就可能因政府保守派的强烈反对而夭折。我立刻意识到这一策略的睿智与远见，欣然接受了这个安排。

于是信函寄出，秦缆聘便来到天津。第二天，总理衙门解散前举行了饯行宴，丁总督在宴席上正式将我介绍给秦缆聘——我此前从未与他谋面，而他即将成为我在教育计划中的合作伙伴。他显然对离开北京感到高兴——毕竟，他已经在刑部做了二十年的小吏，一直未曾有机会担任任何更高职务，也没有任何实际的政务或商业经验。他为人低调，治学严谨；性格温和可亲，但极为胆怯，连一丝一毫的责任都惧怕承担。

1870年冬天，曾国藩处理完天津教案后返回南京，继续担任两江总督。他在南京收到了朝廷对他与丁日昌联名上奏的四项建议的正式批复，表示批准采纳。他随即通知我这一重大喜讯。这是一次历史性的突破，中国的留美教育计划自此成为现实，开启了中华教育史上的一个新时代。曾国藩邀请我前往南京，期间我们就教育使团的核心事务做了详尽安排：包括设立预备学校、每年派遣学生的数量、留学生在美的费用来源以及学习年限等问题。

教育使团由我与秦缆聘两人组成。秦缆聘的职责是督促学生在美国期间继续学习中文，而我则负责他们的西方教育并为他们安排合适的寄宿家庭。我们二人共同管理学生的经费。政府还配备了两名中文教师，专责中文教学，并指定了一名翻译随团服务。这两位教师分别是叶树棟与容云甫，翻译为曾来顺。整个中国留美教育使团的构成即为如此。

关于学生的选拔与条件：总共计划派出120名学生，分四批进行，每年派出30人，连续四年完成。被选学生的年龄需在十二至十五岁之间，必须出身良好，或有值得信赖的监护人。选拔标准包括身体健康、通过中文笔试（依照官定读本及作文）、若曾就读英文学校则须参加英语考试。所有录取者每日必须到预备学校上课，在继续中文学习的同时，开始或继续英文学习，为期至少一年，之后方可启程赴美。

学生的父母或监护人必须签署一份声明，表示完全自愿送子或被监护人出国留学十五年（自赴美学习之日起至完成学业为止），并承诺在此期间，如遇学生死亡或发生任何意外，政府一概不负责任。

政府承诺承担留学生在国外所有费用。每一批学生均配备一名中文教师陪同赴美，并为其配备必要的行装。以上为整个留学生体系的组织与要求。

我在与曾国藩长谈之后，从南京返回上海的第一步，就是在上海设立一所预备学校，容纳首批30名学生。刘开升曾多年担任总督幕府中负责奏章事务的首席书记，被任命为该校校长。他既是我的得力助手，又是热心的朋友，对教育计划极为关切。他亲自负责四批学生的培养和准备工作。

至此，中国方面的留美教育计划于1871年夏正式启动。为凑足首批30名学生，我还特地前往香港，走访英政府所办学校，从中挑选了几名兼具中英文基础的优秀学生。因为当时北方尚未知晓此计划，又无中文报纸传播信息，所以最初的报名者寥寥，且全部来自广东，尤其是香山县。这也就解释了为何120名官费学生中，九成以上皆为南方人。

然而，就在预备学校开学几个月后，1871年冬，中国便失去了一位不可替代的巨人——曾国藩在南京病逝，享年七十一岁。若他能多活一年，定能亲眼见到他亲手种下的第一批三十名留学生踏上赴美征程。然而，伟大的事业奠基者往往无法目睹其成果之辉煌，这是自然与命运的安排；但人的行动与人格，一旦成型，其影响可延续至永恒。曾国藩于教育领域的贡献堪称圆满。他为中国、为后代开创了一项光辉伟业。所有蒙受其恩泽者，都会视他为中华民族的伟大恩人。曾国藩，无论作为政治家、爱国者，还是作为一个人，其卓然之姿犹如珠穆朗玛巍然屹立于喜马拉雅群峰之上，恒久安宁，冰雪皓洁，纯净高远。

据说在他临终前，他曾表示希望由他的门生与继承人李鸿章接棒，继续推进中国留美教育使团的工作。

李鸿章与其卓越的前辈和恩师截然不同。他性情急躁、神经质、反复无常，极易受奉承与赞美所动——用中国话讲，他“好戴高帽子”。他外表粗犷，内心却颇为仁慈。作为政治家，他远逊于曾国藩；作为爱国者和政客，其人格难以经得起历史冷静与公正的拷问。正是在这样一位人物领导下，中国教育使团踏上了新的征程。

1872年夏末，首批三十名中国留学生准备启程横渡太平洋赴美。为确保他们抵达时已有住处，我先行一个月出发，留下秦缆聘、两名教师及翻译稍后搭乘邮件船前来。抵达纽约后，我经由华盛顿，搭乘巴尔的摩与俄亥俄铁路前往新罕布什尔州，欲赴马萨诸塞州斯普林菲尔德，迎接即将到达的学生与其他委员。途经纽黑文，我首先拜访了詹姆斯·哈德利教授，向他通报使命。他见我十分高兴，也为我肩负如此使命而欣喜。在我表明来意后，他立即推荐我去拜访康涅狄格州教育委员B.G.诺思罗普先生。我遵其建议前往，并向诺思罗普说明来意，征求意见。他极力建议我将学生分配至新英格兰地区各家庭中，每户接收两至四人，既便于照顾，又可便于学习，直到他们能够进入正规分级学校。我采纳了他的建议。

之后，我继续前往斯普林菲尔德，将其作为分派学生的中心。此地位置居中，便于学生向新英格兰各地分布，我因此选其为我在美国的最初办公地点，也便于我与老朋友麦克林医生夫妇相聚，他们自1854年起便是我坚定的朋友。

不过，经诺思罗普博士及其他朋友建议，我最终将总部设于康涅狄格州哈特福德市，办公地点设于萨姆纳街，我们在此度过了近两年。斯普林菲尔德仍是学生分派与接收中心，直至1875年三批学生全部抵达。

1874年，经教育使团建议，李鸿章批准我在哈特福德柯林斯街建造一座坚固美观的大楼，作为中国留美教育使团在美的永久总部。1875年1月，我们正式迁入新址。这是一座三层双单元大楼，可容纳教育使团委员、教师及七十五名学生。楼内设有专门教授中文的教室、餐厅、双厨房、宿舍及浴室。我之所以提议建设此永久总部，意在使教育使团在美深深扎根，从而避免中国政府日后因种种原因撤回该计划。此为我的初衷，但后来的事实表明，这并非上天的安排。

第十七章
幼童出洋肄业局

趁诸大臣滞留天津之机，我力促丁日昌将教育计划提交以曾国藩为首的教案善后委员会。丁抚夙知我志，更知三年前曾督已通过他详悉此议。经其斡旋，某夜丁抚深夜叩门相告：曾督与众大臣已联署奏请施行四项提案。是夜我喜不成寐，如踏云霓。两日后，这份以曾国藩领衔的奏折便以六百里加急驰送京师。

委员会解散前议定：由丁日昌举荐刑部郎中陈兰彬与我共同主持留美教育事务。此举实为深谋——陈乃正统翰林出身，有此科班清流坐镇，方能消弭保守势力对"以夷变夏"的攻讦。我欣然领受此策。

陈兰彬抵津次日，丁抚设宴引见。这位蛰居刑部二十年的老翰林性情谦退，学问淹博，却畏事如虎。1870年冬，曾国藩返任两江总督后，朝廷准奏的谕旨抵达南京。曾督急召我赴宁商定要务：设立预备学堂、核定留学生员额、筹措经费、确定修业年限等项。肄业局设正副委员二人，陈兰彬主汉文教习，我司西学督导，共同管理经费。另配汉文教习叶绪东、容云甫，翻译曾兰生。

学生遴选章程严明：

总额120名，分4批逐年派遣，每批30人

年龄12至15岁，需身家清白

通过体检及中文考试（曾习英文者加试）

入沪上预备学堂修业一年方可放洋

家长须立甘结，承诺15年内不归咎生死意外

返沪后即筹建预备学堂，委曾国藩幕中折奏专家刘开生为总办。因北方鲜知此政，首批学童多来自香港英校及香山地区，致后来留美幼童十之八九俱为南籍。

1871年冬，曾文正公以七十一高龄薨逝南京。这位如喜马拉雅主峰般巍峨的政治家，未及亲见首批幼童横渡太平洋的壮举。临终前，他嘱李鸿章继其遗志。然李中堂性躁多疑，好戴高帽，其器识远逊曾公，肄业局命运由此埋下变数。

1872年夏末，首批30名幼童整装待发。我提前一月赴美安排寄宿家庭，依康州教育总监诺斯罗普之议，将学生分散安置于新英格兰地区各家庭。初以麻省春田镇为枢纽，后迁总局于哈特福德柯林斯街，1875年建成宏敞的三层洋楼，设讲堂、膳堂、寝所，可容75人同时修业。我冀以此根基杜绝朝廷反复，然天意终究难测。

（注："甘结"为清代法律文书术语；"折奏专家"对应原文"first secretary in the Department on Memorials"的职能；末段"天意难测"暗伏后文撤局之变）
