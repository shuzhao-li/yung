CHAPTER II 

SCHOOL DAYS 

The Morrison School was opened on the 1st 
of November, 1839, under the charge of the Rev. 
S. R. Brown who, with his wife, Mrs. Brown, 
landed at Macao on the 19th of February, 1839. 
Brown, who was afterwards made a D.D., was 
a graduate of Yale of the class of 1832. From 
his antecedents, he was eminently fitted to 
pioneer the first English school in China. I 
entered the school in 1841. I found that five 
other boys had entered ahead of me by one year. 
They were all studying primary arithmetic, 
geography, and reading. I had the start of them 
only in reading and pronouncing English well. 
We studied English in the forenoon, and 
Chinese in the afternoon. The names of the five 
boys were: 1. Wong Shing; 2. Li Kan; 3. Chow 
Wan; 4 Tong Chik; 5. Wong Foon. I 
made the sixth one and was the youngest of 
all. We formed the first class of the school, and 
became Brown's oldest pupils throughout, from 
first to last, till he left China in December, 1846, 
on account of poor health. Half of our original 
number accompanied him to this country, on his 
return. 

The Morrison Education Society School came 
about in this way: Not long after the death of 
Dr. Robert Morrison, which occurred on the 1st 
of August, 1834, a circular was issued among 
the foreign residents on the 26th of January, 
1835, calling for the formation of an Association 
to be named the "Morrison Education 
Society " Its object was to "improve and promote 
English education in China by schools and 
other means." It was called "Morrison" to 
commemorate the labors and works of that 
distinguished man who was sent out by the London 
Missionary Society as the first missionary to 
China in 1807. He crossed the Atlantic from 
London to New York where he embarked for 
China in the sailing vessel "Trident" on the 31st 
of January, 1807. He tried to land in Macao, 
but the jealousy of the Jesuits thwarted his 
purpose. He was obliged to go up to Canton. 
Finally, on account of the unsettled relations 
between the Chinese government and the foreign 
merchants there, he repaired to Malacca, and 
made that place the basis of his labors. He was 
the author of the first Anglo- Chinese dictionary, 
of three quarto volumes. He translated the 
Bible into Chinese; Leang Afah was his first 
Chinese convert and trained by him to preach. 
Leang afterwards became a powerful preacher. 
The importance and bearing of his dictionary 
and the translation of the Bible into Chinese, on 
subsequent missionary work in China, were 
fundamental and paramount. The preaching of 
his convert, Leang Afah, likewise contributed 
in no small degree towards opening up a new era 
in the religious life of China. His memory, 
therefore, is worthy of being kept alive by the 
establishment of a school named after him. 
Indeed, a university ought to have been perma- 
nently founded for that purpose instead of a 
school, whose existence was solely dependent 
upon the precarious and ephemeral subscriptions 
of transient foreign merchants in China. 

At the close of the Opium War in 1840, and 
after the Island of Hong Kong had been ceded 
to the British government, the Morrison school 
was removed to Hong Kong in 1842. The site 
chosen for it was on the top of a hill about six 
hundred feet above the level of the sea. The hill 
is situated on the eastern end of Victoria Colony 
and was called "Morrison Hill" after the name 
of the school. It commands a fine view of the 
harbor, as that stretches from east to west. The 
harbor alone made Hong Kong the most coveted 
concession in Southern China. It is spacious 
and deep enough to hold the Navy of Great 
Britain, and it is that distinguishing feature and 
its strategic location that have made it what it is. 

On the 12th of March, 1845, Mr. Wm. 
Allen Macy arrived in Hong Kong as an assistant 
teacher in the school. His arrival was 
timely, because the school, since its removal from 
Macao to Hong Kong, had been much enlarged. 
Three more classes of new pupils had been 
formed and the total number of pupils all told 
was more than forty. This was more than one 
man could manage. The assistant teacher was 
much needed. Brown continued his work in the 
school till the fall of 1846. Macy had a whole 
year in which to be broken into the work. 

Between Brown and Macy there was a 
marked difference in temperament and character. 
Brown, on the one hand, showed evidences 
of a self-made man. He was cool in temperament, 
versatile in the adaptation of means to 
ends, gentlemanly and agreeable, and somewhat 
optimistic. He found no difficulty in endearing 
himself to his pupils, because he sympathized 
with them in their efforts to master their studies, 
and entered heart and soul into his work. He 
had an innate faculty of making things clear to 
the pupils and conveying to them his understanding 
of a subject without circumlocution, 
and with great directness and facility. This was 
owing in a great measure to his experience as a 
pedagogue, hefore coming out to China, and 
even hefore he entered college. He knew how to 
manage boys, because he knew boys' nature well, 
whether Chinese, Japanese or American. He 
impressed his pupils as being a fine teacher and 
one eminently fitted from inborn tact and tem- 
perament to be a successful school master, as he 
proved himself to be in his subsequent career in 
Auburn, N.Y., and in Japan. 

Macy, the assistant teacher, was likewise a 
Yale man. He had never taught school before 
in his life, and had no occasion to do so. He 
possessed no previous experience to guide him 
in his new work of pedagogy in China. He was 
evidently well brought up and was a man of 
sensitive nature, and of fine moral sensibilities, 
a soul full of earnestness and lofty ideals. 

After the Morrison School was broken up in 
1850, he returned to this country with his mother 
and took up theology in the Yale Theological 
Seminary. In 1854, he went back to China as 
a missionary under the American Board. I had 
graduated from Yale College then and was 
returning to China with him. We were the only 
passengers in that long, wearisome and most 
trying passage of 154 days from Sandy Hook to 
Hong Kong. 

Brown left China in the winter of 1846. Four 
months before he left, he one day sprang a 
surprise upon the whole school. He told of his 
contemplated return to America on account of 
his health and the health of his family. Before 
closing his remarks by telling us of his deep 
interest in the school, he said he would like to 
take a few of his old pupils home with him to 
finish their education in the United States, and 
that those who wished to accompany him would 
signify it by rising. This announcement, together 
with his decision to return to America, cast a 
deep gloom over the whole school. A dead 
silence came over all of us. And then for several 
days afterwards the burden of our conversation 
was about Brown's leaving the school for good. 
The only cheerful ones among us were those who 
had decided to accompany him home. These 
were Wong Shing, Wong Foon and myself. 
When he requested those who wished to accompany 
him to the States to signify it by rising, I 
was the first one on my feet. Wong Foon was 
the second, followed by Wong Shing. But 
before regarding our cases as permanently 
settled, we were told to go home and ask 
the consent of our respective parents. My 
mother gave her consent with great reluctance, 
but after my earnest persuasion she yielded, 
though not without tears and sorrow. "I consoled 
her with the fact that she had two more sons 
besides myself, and a daughter to look after her 
comfort. Besides, she was going to have a 
daughter-in-law to take care of her, as my elder 
brother was engaged to be married. 

It may not be out of place to say that if it had 
depended on our own resources, we never could 
have come to America to finish our education, 
for we were all poor. Doubtless Brown must 
have had the project well discussed among the 
trustees of the school months before he broached 
the subject to his pupils. 

It was also through his influence that due pro- 
vision was made for the support of our parents 
for at least two years, during our absence in 
America. Our patrons who bore all our ex- 
penses did not intend that we should stay in this 
country longer than two years. They treated 
us nobly. They did a great work for us. Among 
those who bore a conspicuous part in defraying 
our expenses while in America, besides providing 
for the support of our aged parents, I can recall 
the names of Andrew Shortrede, proprietor and 
editor of the "Hong Kong China Mail" (he was 
a Scotchman, an old bachelor, and a noble and 
handsome specimen of humanity), A. A. 
Ritchie, an American merchant, and A. A. 
Campbell, another Scotchman. There were 
others unknown to me. The Olyphant Sons, 
David, Talbot and Robert, three brothers, lead- 
ing merchants of New York, gave us a free 
passage from Hong Kong to New York in their 
sailing vessel, the "Huntress," which brought 
a cargo of tea at the same time. Though late in 
the day for me to mention the names of these 
benefactors who from pure motives of Christian 
philanthropy aided me in my education, yet 
it may be a source of satisfaction to their 
descendants, if there are any living in different 
parts of the world, to know that their sires took 
a prominent part in the education of the three 
Chinese youths, Wong Shing, Wong Foon 
and myself.

马礼逊学堂于1839年11月1日正式开学，由1839年2月19日抵澳的布朗牧师（Rev. S. R. Brown）及其夫人主持校务。这位后来获神学博士的耶鲁1832届毕业生，以其卓越的资质开创了中国第一所西式学堂。我于1841年入学时，已有黄胜、李乾、周文、唐杰、黄宽五位同窗先我一年修习基础算术、地理与阅读课。我们上午学英文，下午习中文，这六人构成了学堂首届也是布朗牧师在华期间（1846年12月因健康原因离华）唯一完整带出的班级，其中半数学生后来随他赴美。

这所纪念首位来华新教传教士马礼逊博士（1807年由伦敦会派遣）的学府，其诞生可追溯至1835年1月26日——这位编纂首部《华英字典》、完成中文圣经翻译、培养出首位华人牧师梁发的先驱者逝世半年后，在华外侨发起成立了以"通过办学等方式推进中国英文教育"为宗旨的马礼逊教育会。倘若当时建立的不是这所依赖商人临时捐款的学堂，而是一所永久性大学，或许更能匹配这位奠基者的历史地位。

1840年鸦片战争结束后，随着香港割让，学堂于1842年迁至维多利亚殖民地东端的摩理臣山（今香港铜锣湾附近）。这座海拔六百英尺的山丘俯瞰东西走向的天然良港，正是这个可停泊英国舰队的深水港使香港成为华南最令人垂涎的要塞。

1845年3月12日，威廉·艾伦·梅西（Wm. Allen Macy）抵港任教。此时学生已增至四十余人，分四个班级。这位毫无教学经验的耶鲁毕业生与布朗风格迥异：布朗是位善于因材施教的绅士，能用简洁明了的方式传授知识，其后来在纽约奥本及日本的办学成就印证了这种天赋；而梅西则敏感细腻，满怀道德热忱，1850年学堂关闭后他返美进入耶鲁神学院，1854年作为美部会传教士再度来华时，恰与我——当时已从耶鲁毕业——同船历经154天漫长航程。

1846年冬布朗离华前四个月，某日他突然宣布因健康原因拟携数名弟子赴美深造。当要求志愿赴美者起立时，我第一个站了起来，随后是黄宽、黄胜。经过艰难说服，母亲最终含泪应允——毕竟她还有两子一女及即将过门的儿媳照料。若非教育会董事们预先筹款（包括负担我们父母两年赡养费），我们这些贫寒学子绝无可能赴美。资助者中，《德臣报》创办人苏格兰人萧德锐（Andrew Shortrede）、美国商人黎吉（A. A. Ritchie）、苏格兰人金贝尔（A. A. Campbell）尤为慷慨，而纽约奥立芬洋行三兄弟更提供"亨特里斯号"商船免费舱位。这些基督徒慈善家的义举，或许其散居世界各地的后裔至今仍引以为荣。

求学时期

马礼逊学校于1839年11月1日正式开办，由S.R.布朗牧师负责主持。布朗牧师和夫人布朗女士于1839年2月19日抵达澳门。布朗后来获得神学博士学位（D.D.），他是耶鲁大学1832年毕业生。凭借其背景与资历，他非常适合担任中国第一所英文学校的开拓者。

我于1841年进入该校。当时已有五名男孩比我早一年入学。他们正在学习初级算术、地理和英文阅读。我只在英文朗读和发音方面略胜他们一筹。我们每天上午学习英文，下午学习中文。这五名学生的名字是：1. 黄胜；2. 李勤；3. 周允；4. 唐直；5. 黄寬。我是第六位，也是年纪最小的一个。我们六人组成了学校的第一届学生班级，并成为布朗牧师自始至终最早、最资深的学生，直到他于1846年12月因健康不佳离开中国为止。我们原班六人中有一半人随他一起回到美国。

马礼逊教育会学校的设立由来如下：1834年8月1日，罗伯特·马礼逊博士去世后不久，于1835年1月26日，一封通告在外籍居民中流传，倡议成立一个名为“马礼逊教育会”的机构。其宗旨是“通过学校和其他方式提升并推广在中国的英语教育”。之所以取名“马礼逊”，是为了纪念这位杰出的先驱人物。他是由伦敦传道会派出的第一位来华传教士，于1807年启程。他先从伦敦横渡大西洋抵达纽约，然后于1807年1月31日搭乘“特里丹号”帆船前往中国。他本想在澳门登陆，但因耶稣会的排斥而未能如愿，遂前往广州。后因清政府与外国商人关系紧张，他又迁往马六甲，并以该地为传教据点。

他是第一部《英华字典》的作者，共三大卷。他还将《圣经》翻译成中文。梁阿发是他第一位华人皈依者，亦由他亲自栽培成为传道者，后来成为极具影响力的布道家。他编纂的字典和《圣经》译本对日后中国的传教事业有着基础性和决定性的影响。梁阿发的讲道活动也在推动中国宗教生活迈入新纪元方面功不可没。因而，以他的名字设立一所学校，是对其功绩最应得的纪念。事实上，应当为此创办一所大学，而非一所存在本就仰赖短期在华外国商人捐款、缺乏长久保障的学校。

鸦片战争于1840年结束后，香港岛被割让给英国政府。马礼逊学校遂于1842年迁至香港。新校址位于海拔约六百英尺的山顶上，该山位于维多利亚殖民地的东端，被命名为“马礼逊山”，以纪念学校。此处可俯瞰整个维多利亚港，其海港自东向西延伸，是香港最珍贵的资源。港湾宽阔而深，可容纳整个英国海军舰队，正是其地理优势与港口特色，使香港成为南中国最理想的殖民地。

1845年3月12日，Wm. Allen Macy先生抵达香港，担任该校助教。他的到来正当其时，因为学校自从迁往香港后规模扩大，新增了三个班级，学生总人数已超过四十人，一人已无法独自管理。此时非常需要助教。布朗牧师在学校工作至1846年秋季，Macy有整整一年时间熟悉工作。

布朗与Macy在性格与气质上迥然不同。布朗牧师可谓白手起家，他性格沉稳，擅长因应情势，风度翩翩、和蔼可亲，且略带乐观。他乐于与学生打成一片，设身处地帮助他们克服学习难关，全心投入教学工作。他有天赋，能将复杂内容用简洁明了的方式教导学生，条理清晰、直截了当。这多半得益于他来华之前在美国已有教学经验，甚至在上大学之前就已从教。他深谙青少年心理，善于因材施教，无论对中国、日本或美国的学生，皆能得心应手。他留给学生的印象是一位极具天赋的优秀教师，凭借天性与修养成为卓越的教育者，这也在他后来于纽约奥本和日本的教育事业中得到印证。

Macy助教同样毕业于耶鲁大学，但他此前从未教过书，也未曾接触过教学工作。他毫无经验可资借鉴。他显然是出身良好，性格敏感，道德感强，心怀高远理想，是一个满腔热情之人。

1850年马礼逊学校解散后，他带母亲回到美国，并进入耶鲁神学院研修神学。1854年他作为美国差会的传教士返回中国。当时我已从耶鲁毕业，随他一同回国。那段旅程从桑迪胡克出发，经154天漫长而艰苦的航行到达香港，只有我和他两位乘客。

布朗牧师于1846年冬天离开中国。在离开前四个月，他有一天突然在全校宣布一个消息。他说因为自己和家人的健康原因，将要返回美国。他还说，自己非常关心这所学校，希望带几位老学生一起去美国完成学业。有意随他同行者请起立。他的这一宣布，以及即将返美的决定，给全校带来了沉重的气氛，鸦雀无声。接下来的几天，大家谈论最多的就是布朗的离别。唯独我们中决定随他前往的几人较为欣喜。这三人是黄胜、黄寬和我。当他征询愿意同行者时，我第一个站起，接着是黄寬，随后是黄胜。但最终是否成行，还须获得家长同意。我母亲最初极为不舍，但在我苦苦请求下终于同意，虽满含泪水。

我安慰母亲说她还有两个儿子和一个女儿可以照料她的生活，况且我哥哥已经订婚，将来会有儿媳陪伴她。

我必须说，若仅凭我们自身条件，我们根本不可能负担得起赴美留学的费用。我们都出身贫寒。布朗牧师早在宣布此事前，想必已与学校董事会反复商议。

也正是通过他的努力，我们的家人得到了至少两年的生活资助。在美期间，所有开销皆由赞助人承担，他们原本只打算资助我们在美学习两年。我们受到了极大的善待。

在资助我们赴美求学并照顾年迈父母生活的众多恩人中，我记得几位尤为慷慨者：Andrew Shortrede，《香港华字日报》创办人兼主编，一位苏格兰人，单身汉，仪表堂堂且富有仁心；A. A. Ritchie，一位美国商人；以及A. A. Campbell，另一位苏格兰商人。还有其他我不认识的人也提供了帮助。纽约的Olyphant三兄弟——大卫、塔尔博特和罗伯特——著名商人，免费为我们提供了从香港至纽约的船票，船名为“Huntress号”，这也是一艘满载茶叶的商船。虽然如今提及这些恩人已时隔多年，但如果他们的后代还健在，得知祖辈曾在三位中国少年——黄胜、黄寬和我——的教育之路上贡献良多，也许会感到些许欣慰。
