CHAPTER II 

SCHOOL DAYS 

The Morrison School was opened on the 1st 
of November, 1839, under the charge of the Rev. 
S. R. Brown who, with his wife, Mrs. Brown, 
landed at Macao on the 19th of February, 1839. 
Brown, who was afterwards made a D.D., was 
a graduate of Yale of the class of 1832. From 
his antecedents, he was eminently fitted to 
pioneer the first English school in China. I 
entered the school in 1841. I found that five 
other boys had entered ahead of me by one year. 
They were all studying primary arithmetic, 
geography, and reading. I had the start of them 
only in reading and pronouncing English well. 
We studied English in the forenoon, and 
Chinese in the afternoon. The names of the five 
boys were: 1. Wong Shing; 2. Li Kan; 3. Chow 
Wan; 4 Tong Chik; 5. Wong Foon. I 
made the sixth one and was the youngest of 
all. We formed the first class of the school, and 
became Brown's oldest pupils throughout, from 
first to last, till he left China in December, 1846, 
on account of poor health. Half of our original

number accompanied him to this country, on his 
return. 

The Morrison Education Society School came 
about in this way: Not long after the death of 
Dr. Robert Morrison, which occurred on the 1st 
of August, 1834, a circular was issued among 
the foreign residents on the 26th of January, 
1835, calling for the formation of an Associa- 
tion to be named the "Morrison Education 
Society " Its object was to "improve and pro- 
mote English education in China by schools and 
other means." It was called "Morrison" to 
commemorate the labors and works of that dis- 
tinguished man who was sent out by the London 
Missionary Society as the first missionary to 
China in 1807. He crossed the Atlantic from 
London to New York where he embarked for 
China in the sailing vessel "Trident" on the 31st 
of January, 1807. He tried to land in Macao, 
but the jealousy of the Jesuits thwarted his 
purpose. He was obliged to go up to Canton. 
Finally, on account of the unsettled relations 
between the Chinese government and the foreign 
merchants there, he repaired to Malacca, and 
made that place the basis of his labors. He was 
the author of the first Anglo- Chinese dictionary, 
of three quarto volumes. He translated the 



SCHOOL DAYS 15 

Bible into Chinese; Leang Afah was his first 
Chinese convert and trained by him to preach. 
Leang afterwards became a powerful preacher. 
The importance and bearing of his dictionary 
and the translation of the Bible into Chinese, on 
subsequent missionary work in China, were 
fundamental and paramount. The preaching of 
his convert, Leang Afah, likewise contributed 
in no small degree towards opening up a new era 
in the religious life of China. His memory, 
therefore, is worthy of being kept alive by the 
establishment of a school named after him. 
Indeed, a university ought to have been perma- 
nently founded for that purpose instead of a 
school, whose existence was solely dependent 
upon the precarious and ephemeral subscriptions 
of transient foreign merchants in China. 

At the close of the Opium War in 1840, and 
after the Island of Hong Kong had been ceded 
to the British government, the Morrison school 
was removed to Hong Kong in 1842. The site 
chosen for it was on the top of a hill about six 
hundred feet above the level of the sea. The hill 
is situated on the eastern end of Victoria Colony 
and was called "Morrison Hill" after the name 
of the school. It commands a fine view of the 
harbor, as that stretches from east to west. The 



16 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

harbor alone made Hong Kong the most coveted 
concession in Southern China. It is spacious 
and deep enough to hold the Navy of Great 
Britain, and it is that distinguishing feature and 
its strategic location that have made it what it is. 

On the 12th of March, 1845, Mr. Wm. 
Allen Macy arrived in Hong Kong as an assist- 
ant teacher in the school. His arrival was 
timely, because the school, since its removal from 
Macao to Hong Kong, had been much enlarged. 
Three more classes of new pupils had been 
formed and the total number of pupils all told 
was more than forty. This was more than one 
man could manage. The assistant teacher was 
much needed. Brown continued his work in the 
school till the fall of 1846. Macy had a whole 
year in which to be broken into the work. 

Between Brown and Macy there was a 
marked difference in temperament and charac- 
ter. Brown, on the one hand, showed evidences 
of a self-made man. He was cool in tempera- 
ment, versatile in the adaptation of means to 
ends, gentlemanly and agreeable, and somewhat 
optimistic. He found no difficulty in endearing 
himself to his pupils, because he sympathized 
with them in their efforts to master their studies, 
and entered heart and soul into his work. He 



SCHOOL DAYS 17 

had an innate faculty of making things clear to 
the pupils and conveying to them his under- 
standing of a subject without circumlocution, 
and with great directness and facility. This was 
owing in a great measure to his experience as a 
pedagogue, hefore coming out to China, and 
even hefore he entered college. He knew how to 
manage boys, because he knew boys' nature well, 
whether Chinese, Japanese or American. He 
impressed his pupils as being a fine teacher and 
one eminently fitted from inborn tact and tem- 
perament to be a successful school master, as he 
proved himself to be in his subsequent career in 
Auburn, 1ST. Y,, and in Japan. 

Macy, the assistant teacher, was likewise a 
Yale man. He had never taught school before 
in his life, and had no occasion to do so. He 
possessed no previous experience to guide him 
in his new work of pedagogy in China. He was 
evidently well brought up and was a man of 
sensitive nature, and of fine moral sensibilities, 
a soul full of earnestness and lofty ideals. 

After the Morrison School was broken up in 
1850, he returned to this country with his mother 
and took up theology in the Yale Theological 
Seminary. In 1854, he went back to China as 
a missionary under the American Board. I had 



18 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

graduated from Yale College then and was 
returning to China with him. We were the only 
passengers in that long, wearisome and most try- 
ing passage of 154 days from Sandy Hook to 
Hong Kong. 

Brown left China in the winter of 1846. Four 
months before he left, he one day sprang a sur- 
prise upon the whole school. He told of his 
contemplated return to America on account of 
his health and the health of his family. Before 
closing his remarks by telling us of his deep 
interest in the school, he said he would like to 
take a few of his old pupils home with him to 
finish their education in the United States, and 
that those who wished to accompany him would 
signify it by rising. This announcement, together 
with his decision to return to America, cast a 
deep gloom over the whole school. A dead 
silence came over all of us. And then for several 
days afterwards the burden of our conversation 
was about Brown's leaving the school for good. 
The only cheerful ones among us were those who 
had decided to accompany him home. These 
were Wong Shing, Wong Foon and myself. 
When he requested those who wished to accom- 
pany him to the States to signify it by rising, I 
was the first one on my feet. Wong Foon was 



SCHOOL DAYS 19 

the second, followed by Wong Shing. But 
before regarding our cases as permanently 
settled, we were told to go home and ask 
the consent of our respective parents. My 
mother gave her consent with great reluctance, 
but after my earnest persuasion she yielded, 
though not without tears and sorrow. "I consoled 
her with the fact that she had two more sons 
besides myself, and a daughter to look after her 
comfort. Besides, she was going to have a 
daughter-in-law to take care of her, as my elder 
brother was engaged to be married. 

It may not be out of place to say that if it had 
depended on our own resources, we never could 
have come to America to finish our education, 
for we were all poor. Doubtless Brown must 
have had the project well discussed among the 
trustees of the school months before he broached 
the subject to his pupils. 

It was also through his influence that due pro- 
vision was made for the support of our parents 
for at least two years, during our absence in 
America. Our patrons who bore all our ex- 
penses did not intend that we should stay in this 
country longer than two years. They treated 
us nobly. They did a great work for us. Among 
those who bore a conspicuous part in defraying 



20 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

our expenses while in America, besides providing 
for the support of our aged parents, I can recall 
the names of Andrew Shortrede, proprietor and 
editor of the "Hong Kong China Mail" (he was 
a Scotchman, an old bachelor, and a noble and 
handsome specimen of humanity), A. A. 
Ritchie, an American merchant, and A. A. 
Campbell, another Scotchman. There were 
others unknown to me. The Olyphant Sons, 
David, Talbot and Robert, three brothers, lead- 
ing merchants of New York, gave us a free 
passage from Hong Kong to New York in their 
sailing vessel, the "Huntress," which brought 
a cargo of tea at the same time. Though late in 
the day for me to mention the names of these 
benefactors who from pure motives of Christian 
philanthropy aided me in my education, yet 
it may be a source of satisfaction to their 
descendants, if there are any living in different 
parts of the world, to know that their sires took 
a prominent part in the education of the three 
Chinese youths, Wong Shing, Wong Foon 
and myself.
