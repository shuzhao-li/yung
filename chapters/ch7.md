CHAPTER VII 
EFFORT TO FIND A POSITION 

Having at last succeeded in mastering the 
spoken language sufficiently to speak it quite 
fluently, I at once set to work to find a position 
in which I could not only support myself and 
mother, but also form a plan for working out my 
ideas of reform in China. 

Doctor Peter Parker, who had been a medical 
missionary under the American Board for many 
years in Canton, was at that time made United 
States Commissioner as a temporary expedient, 
to take the place of an accredited minister pleni- 
potentiary a diplomatic appointment not yet 
come into existence, because the question of a 
foreign minister resident in Peking was still 
under negotiation, and had not been fully set- 
tled as a permanent diplomatic arrangement 
between the Peking government and the Treaty 
Powers. Dr. Parker was given the appointment 
of commissioner on account of his long residence 
in China and his ability to speak the Chinese 

language, but not on account of any special 
training as a diplomat, nor for legal knowledge, 
It was through Mr. M. N. Hitchcock, an 
American merchant of the firm of Messrs* King 
& Co., and a mutual friend of Dr. Parker and 
myself, that I hecame the Doctor's private 
secretary. I knew Dr. Parker while I was at 
Mrs. GutzlafFs School, and he doubtless knew 
I had recently graduated from Yale, which was 
his Alma Mater also. His headquarters were 
in Canton, but he spent his summers in Macao. 
I was with him only three months. My salary 
was $15 a month (not large enough to spoil me 
at any rate) . He had very little for me to do, but 
I thought that by being identified with him, 
I might possibly come in contact with Chinese 
officials. However, this was far from being the 
case. Seeing that I could neither learn anything 
from him, nor enlarge my acquaintance with the 
Chinese officials, I gave up my position as his 
secretary and went over to Hong Kong to try 
to study law. Through my old friend, Andrew 
Shortrede, who generously extended to me the 
hospitality of his house, I succeeded in securing 
the position of the interpretership in the Hong 
Kong Supreme Court. The situation paid me 
$75 a month. Having this to fall back upon, 
I felt encouraged to go ahead in my effort to 
study law. Accordingly, I was advised to 
apprentice myself to an attorney or solicitor- 
at-law. In the English court of practice, it 
seems that there are two distinct classes of 
lawyers attorneys or solicitors, and barristers. 
.The first prepares in writing all evidences, facts, 
and proofs of a case, hands them to the barrister 
or counsel, who argues the case in court accord- 
ing to law. 

I apprenticed myself to an attorney, who was 
recommended to me by my old patron and 
friend, Shortrede. I was not aware that by 
going into the British Colony in Hong Kong 
to become an attorney, I was stepping on the 
toes of the British legal fraternity, nor that by 
apprenticing myself to an attorney instead of to 
the new attorney-general of the Colony, who, 
without my knowledge, wanted me himself, I 
had committed another mistake, which event- 
ually necessitated my leaving Hong Kong 
altogether. 

First of all, all the attorneys banded them- 
selves together against me, because, as they 
openly stated in all the local papers except the 
"China Mail," if I were allowed to practice my 
profession, they might as well pack up and go 
back to England, for as I had a complete knowl- 
edge of both English and Chinese I would 
eventually monopolize all the Chinese legal 
business. So they made it too hot for me to 
continue in my studies. 

In the next place, I was not aware that the 
attorney-general wanted me to apprentice 
myself to him, for he did all he could in his 
capacity as attorney-general of the Colony to 
use his influence to open the way for me to 
become an attorney, by draughting a special 
colonial ordinance to admit Chinese to practice 
in the Hong Kong Colony as soon as I could 
pass my examinations. This ordinance was 
sent to the British government to be sanctioned 
by Parliament before it became valid and a 
colonial law. It was sanctioned and thus became 
a colonial ordinance. 

In the meanwhile, Anstey, the attorney- 
general, found out that I had already appren- 
ticed myself to Parson, the attorney. From 
that time forth I had no peace. I was between 
two fires the batteries operated by the attor- 
neys opened on me with redoubled energy, and 
the new battery, operated by the attorney-gen- 
eral, opened its fire. He found fault with my 
interpreting, which he had never done previously. 
Mr. Parson saw how things stood. He himself 
was also under a hot fire from both sides. So 
in order to save himself, he told me plainly and 
candidly that he had to give me up and made the 
article of apprenticeship between us null and 
void. I, on my part, had to give up my position 
as interpreter in the Supreme Court. Parson, 
himself, not long after I had abandoned my 
apprenticeship and my position as interpreter, 
for reasons satisfactory to himself, gave up his 
business in Hong Kong and returned to Eng- 
land. So master and pupil left their posts at 
pretty nearly the same time. 

A retrospective view of my short experience 
in Hong Kong convinced me that it was after 
all the best thing that I did not succeed in 
becoming a lawyer in Hong Kong, as the theatre 
of action there would have been too restricted 
and circumscribed. I could not have come in 
touch with the leading minds of China, had I 
been bound up in that rocky and barren Colony. 
Doubtless I might have made a fortune if I had 
succeeded in my legal profession, but as circum- 
stances forced me to leave the Colony, my mind 
was directed northward to Shanghai, and in 
August, 1856, I left Hong Kong in the tea 
clipper, "Florence," under Captain Dumaresque, 
of Boston, He was altogether a different type 
of man from the captain of the "Eureka" 
which brought me out in 1855. He was kind, 
intelligent and gentlemanly. When he found 
out who I was, he offered me a free passage 
from Hong Kong to Shanghai, He was, in 
fact, the sole owner of the vessel, which was 
named after his daughter, Florence. The pas- 
sage was a short one lasting only seven days 
but before it was over, we became great friends. 

Not long after my arrival in Shanghai, I 
found a situation in the Imperial Customs 
Translating Department, at a salary of Tls. 75 
a month, equivalent to $100 Mexican. For want 
of a Chinese silver currency the Mexican dollar 
was adopted. This was one point better than 
the interpretership in the Hong Kong Supreme 
Court. The duties were not arduous and trying. 
In fact, they were too simple and easy to suit 
my taste and ambition. I had plenty of time to 
read. Before three months of trial in my new 
situation, I found that things were not as they 
should be, and if I wished to keep a clean and 
clear record and an untarnished character, I 
could not remain long in the service. Between 
the interpreters who had been in the service many 
years and the Chinese shippers there existed a 
regular system of graft. After learning this, 
and not wishing to be implicated with the others 
in the division of the spoils in any way or shape, 
I made up my mind to resign. So one day I 
called upon the Chief Commissioner of Customs, 
ostensibly to find out what my future prospects 
were in connection with the Customs Service 
whether or not there were any prospects of my 
being promoted to the position of a commis- 
sioner, I was told that no such prospects were 
held out to me or to any other Chinese interpre- 
ter. I, therefore, at once decided to throw up 
my position. So I sent in my resignation, which 
was at first not accepted. A few days after my 
first interview, Lay, the chief commissioner, 
strenuously tried to persuade me to change my 
mind, and offered as an inducement to raise my 
salary to Tls. 200 a month, evidently thinking 
that I was only bluffing in order to get higher 
wages. It did not occur to him that there was at 
least one Chinaman who valued a clean reputa- 
tion and an honest character more than money; 
that being an educated man, I saw no reason 
why I should not be given the same chances to 
rise in the service of the Chinese government as 
an Englishman, nor why my individuality should 
not be recognized and respected in every walk 
of life. He little thought that I had aspirations 
even higher than his, and that I did not care 
to associate myself with a pack of Custom-house 
interpreters and inspectors, who were known to 
take bribes; that a man who expects others to 
respect him, must first respect himself. Such 
were my promptings, I did not state the real 
cause of my quitting the service, but at the 
end of four months' trial I left the service in 
order to try my fortune in new fields more 
congenial. 

My friends at the time looked upon me as a 
crank in throwing up a position yielding me 
Tls, 200 a month for something uncertain and 
untried. This in their estimation was the height 
of folly. They little realized what I was driving 
at. I had a clean record and I meant to keep it 
clean. I was perfectly aware that in less than 
a year since my return to China, I had made 
three shifts. I myself began to think I was 
too mercurial to accomplish anything substan- 
tial, or that I was too dreamy to be practical or 
too proud to succeed in life. But in a strenuous 
life one needs to be a dreamer in order to accom- 
plish possibilities. We are not called into being 
simply to drudge for an animal existence. I 
had had to work hard for my education, and I 
felt that I ought to make the most of what little 
I had, not so much to benefit myself individually 
as to make it a blessing common to my race. By 
these shifts and changes I was only trying to 
find my true bearing, and how I could make 
myself a blessing to China.

第七章
谋职经历

在终于掌握了足以流利会话的中文之后，我立即着手寻找一个职位，不仅为了养活我自己和母亲，更是为了能逐步实现我对中国改革的设想。

彼得·柏克医生（Dr. Peter Parker），曾在美国差会（American Board）名下担任多年医疗传教士，时任美国驻华临时代办，这只是一个临时安排，因为当时尚未正式设立驻华公使职位。关于外国使节常驻北京的事务仍在谈判中，尚未成为清政府与条约国之间正式而永久的外交安排。柏克博士之所以被任命为代办，是因为他长期居住中国且能讲中文，而并非由于他有外交或法律方面的特别训练。

我之所以成为柏克博士的私人秘书，是通过M.N.希区考克先生（Mr. M. N. Hitchcock）的引荐。他是一位美籍商人，任职于金公司（Messrs. King & Co.），与柏克博士和我都有交情。我在古德拉夫夫人（Mrs. Gützlaff）的学校求学期间就已认识柏克博士，他显然也知道我最近从耶鲁大学毕业——那也是他的母校。他的办公地点在广州，但夏季常居澳门。我在他身边只工作了三个月，月薪十五美元（至少这薪资不会让我堕落）。他交给我的工作不多，但我当时想，能和他共事，也许能借此接触中国官员。可事实远非如此。我既无法从他身上学到什么，也无法扩大我与中国官员的联系，于是我辞去了秘书的职务，前往香港学习法律。

在我老朋友安德鲁·肖特里德（Andrew Shortrede）慷慨地让我住在他家期间，我成功地获得了香港最高法院的口译职位，月薪七十五美元。有了这份工作作保障，我下定决心继续法律学习。于是我受到建议，要拜一位律师为师。在英国的法律体制中，律师分为两种：一类是律师或代理律师（attorney 或 solicitor），他们负责编写案件材料、证据和事实；另一类是出庭律师（barrister 或 counsel），专责在法庭上据理力争。

我拜了一位叫帕森（Parson）的律师为师，他是由我那位老朋友肖特里德推荐的。我当时并不知道，进入香港这个英属殖民地从事律师行业，其实是踩到了英籍法律界的利益，而且我并未拜殖民地新任检察总长（Attorney-General）为师——他事后透露其实早就想收我为徒——因此又无意间犯下了一个错误，这最终导致我不得不离开香港。

首先，所有的律师联合起来反对我，因为他们在所有本地报纸上（除了《中国邮报》（China Mail））公开表示：如果让我执业，那他们干脆回英国好了。因为我既懂英语又懂中文，将来肯定会垄断所有与华人相关的法律业务。因此，他们想尽办法使我无法继续学业。

其次，我事先并不知道检察总长有意收我为徒。他实际上在尽力为我打开律师之路，还起草了一项殖民地特别法令，只要我通过考试，就允许华人在香港执业。这项法令被送往英国政府，待议会批准后才正式生效，成为殖民地法律。

然而，检察总长安斯蒂（Anstey）后来得知我已经拜帕森为师，从那之后我就如同处在两面夹击之中：一方面是律师们更猛烈的攻击，另一方面是检察总长也开始发难。他开始挑剔我担任翻译的表现——此前他从未批评过。我师父帕森看清了局势。他自己也同样处于两面受压的处境。于是，为了自保，他坦率地告诉我必须解除师徒关系，我们之间的学徒协议作废。我只得辞去了最高法院口译的职务。不久之后，帕森本人也因为自己的考虑，退出了在香港的业务，回到英国。师徒几乎在同一时间离开了各自的岗位。

回顾我在香港短暂的经历，我渐渐意识到，其实我未能在香港成为一名律师反倒是好事。那里施展拳脚的舞台太狭小，若是被困在这块贫瘠岩岛上，我永远也接触不到中国的核心人物。若在法律行业中有所成就，我或许能发一笔财，但既然时势迫使我离开了香港，我便将目光转向上海。1856年8月，我搭乘茶船“佛罗伦斯号”（Florence）离港，船长杜马雷斯克（Dumaresque）是波士顿人。他和我当年来华所乘“尤里卡号”（Eureka）的船长截然不同，是位仁厚、聪明而有教养的绅士。当他得知我的身份后，便慷慨地为我提供了从香港到上海的免费船票。这艘船以他女儿“佛罗伦斯”的名字命名，且为他私人所有。旅程很短，仅七天，但在航程结束前，我们已成莫逆之交。

我到达上海后不久，便找到一份在总税务司翻译处的工作，月薪七十五两银，相当于一百墨西哥元。由于当时尚无中国统一银币制度，墨西哥银元被广泛使用。这份职位比在香港最高法院担任口译略胜一筹，工作不繁重，也不具挑战性，反而太轻松，不符合我的志向和性情。我有大把时间读书。三个月试用期未满，我就意识到情况不对——如果我想保持一份清白无瑕的声誉，我就不能继续留在税务部门。

在那些长期任职的翻译与中国货主之间，存在一套“分肥”制度。了解真相后，我不愿以任何方式卷入这些非法利益的瓜分中，便决定辞职。我拜访了总税务司，表面上是去咨询我在海关体系内的晋升前景，实则想探知自己未来是否有可能担任税务司。他直言不讳地告诉我，不论我还是其他任何一位华籍翻译，都没有晋升为税务司的可能。

于是我立刻决定辞职。我递交了辞呈，起初并未被接受。几天后，海关总税务司莱伊（Lay）极力劝我留下，并提出将我的月薪升至两百两银，显然他以为我只是借辞职来要挟加薪。他未曾想到，中国人中也有重视清誉和诚实的人；也未曾料到，我身为一名受过教育的中国人，理应享有与英国人一样的晋升机会，不应在任何领域被轻视。我比他想象的有更远大的抱负，我不愿与那些以受贿闻名的口译员和查验员为伍。一个人若希望赢得他人的尊重，首先要学会自重。

我并没有对外说明我辞职的真正原因。试用了四个月后，我毅然离开税务司，去寻求更符合志趣的天地。

我当时的朋友们都认为我是疯子，竟然放弃了一份月薪两百两的“铁饭碗”，去追求毫无把握的新出路。在他们眼中，这是愚蠢至极。他们根本不理解我真正的追求。我有一份清白的记录，我决心要保持它的清白。我也意识到，回国不到一年，我已经换了三次工作。我开始怀疑自己是否太浮躁、太理想化、不够务实，或者说太骄傲以致难以在现实社会中立足。

但我也明白，在追求理想的人生中，一个人必须敢于梦想，才能创造可能。我们生而为人，不应只是为了衣食住行而活。我努力学习，是希望将我所学的知识不仅用于个人，更要为整个民族谋福祉。我之所以频繁更换工作，是在寻找真正适合自己的方向，寻找能使我成为中国之福的道路。
