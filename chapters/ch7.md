CHAPTER VII 
EFFORT TO FIND A POSITION 

Having at last succeeded in mastering the 
spoken language sufficiently to speak it quite 
fluently, I at once set to work to find a position 
in which I could not only support myself and 
mother, but also form a plan for working out my 
ideas of reform in China. 

Doctor Peter Parker, who had been a medical 
missionary under the American Board for many 
years in Canton, was at that time made United 
States Commissioner as a temporary expedient, 
to take the place of an accredited minister pleni- 
potentiary a diplomatic appointment not yet 
come into existence, because the question of a 
foreign minister resident in Peking was still 
under negotiation, and had not been fully set- 
tled as a permanent diplomatic arrangement 
between the Peking government and the Treaty 
Powers. Dr. Parker was given the appointment 
of commissioner on account of his long residence 
in China and his ability to speak the Chinese 

language, but not on account of any special

training as a diplomat, nor for legal knowledge, 
It was through Mr. M. N. Hitchcock, an 
American merchant of the firm of Messrs* King 
& Co., and a mutual friend of Dr. Parker and 
myself, that I hecame the Doctor's private 
secretary. I knew Dr. Parker while I was at 
Mrs. GutzlafFs School, and he doubtless knew 
I had recently graduated from Yale, which was 
his Alma Mater also. His headquarters were 
in Canton, but he spent his summers in Macao. 
I was with him only three months. My salary 
was $15 a month (not large enough to spoil me 
at any rate) . He had very little for me to do, but 
I thought that by being identified with him, 
I might possibly come in contact with Chinese 
officials. However, this was far from being the 
case. Seeing that I could neither learn anything 
from him, nor enlarge my acquaintance with the 
Chinese officials, I gave up my position as his 
secretary and went over to Hong Kong to try 
to study law. Through my old friend, Andrew 
Shortrede, who generously extended to me the 
hospitality of his house, I succeeded in securing 
the position of the interpretership in the Hong 
Kong Supreme Court. The situation paid me 
$75 a month. Having this to fall back upon, 
I felt encouraged to go ahead in my effort to 



60 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

study law. Accordingly, I was advised to 
apprentice myself to an attorney or solicitor- 
at-law. In the English court of practice, it 
seems that there are two distinct classes of 
lawyers attorneys or solicitors, and barristers. 
.The first prepares in writing all evidences, facts, 
and proofs of a case, hands them to the barrister 
or counsel, who argues the case in court accord- 
ing to law. 

I apprenticed myself to an attorney, who was 
recommended to me by my old patron and 
friend, Shortrede. I was not aware that by 
going into the British Colony in Hong Kong 
to become an attorney, I was stepping on the 
toes of the British legal fraternity, nor that by 
apprenticing myself to an attorney instead of to 
the new attorney-general of the Colony, who, 
without my knowledge, wanted me himself, I 
had committed another mistake, which event- 
ually necessitated my leaving Hong Kong 
altogether. 

First of all, all the attorneys banded them- 
selves together against me, because, as they 
openly stated in all the local papers except the 
"China Mail," if I were allowed to practice my 
profession, they might as well pack up and go 
back to England, for as I had a complete knowl-

edge of both English and Chinese I would 
eventually monopolize all the Chinese legal 
business. So they made it too hot for me to 
continue in my studies. 

In the next place, I was not aware that the 
attorney-general wanted me to apprentice 
myself to him, for he did all he could in his 
capacity as attorney-general of the Colony to 
use his influence to open the way for me to 
become an attorney, by draughting a special 
colonial ordinance to admit Chinese to practice 
in the Hong Kong Colony as soon as I could 
pass my examinations. This ordinance was 
sent to the British government to be sanctioned 
by Parliament before it became valid and a 
colonial law. It was sanctioned and thus became 
a colonial ordinance. 

In the meanwhile, Anstey, the attorney- 
general, found out that I had already appren- 
ticed myself to Parson, the attorney. From 
that time forth I had no peace. I was between 
two fires the batteries operated by the attor- 
neys opened on me with redoubled energy, and 
the new battery, operated by the attorney-gen- 
eral, opened its fire. He found fault with my 
interpreting, which he had never done previously. 
Mr. Parson saw how things stood. He himself 



62 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

was also under a hot fire from both sides. So 
in order to save himself, he told me plainly and 
candidly that he had to give me up and made the 
article of apprenticeship between us null and 
void. I, on my part, had to give up my position 
as interpreter in the Supreme Court. Parson, 
himself, not long after I had abandoned my 
apprenticeship and my position as interpreter, 
for reasons satisfactory to himself, gave up his 
business in Hong Kong and returned to Eng- 
land. So master and pupil left their posts at 
pretty nearly the same time. 

A retrospective view of my short experience 
in Hong Kong convinced me that it was after 
all the best thing that I did not succeed in 
becoming a lawyer in Hong Kong, as the theatre 
of action there would have been too restricted 
and circumscribed. I could not have come in 
touch with the leading minds of China, had I 
been bound up in that rocky and barren Colony. 
Doubtless I might have made a fortune if I had 
succeeded in my legal profession, but as circum- 
stances forced me to leave the Colony, my mind 
was directed northward to Shanghai, and in 
August, 1856, I left Hong Kong in the tea 
clipper, "Florence," under Captain Dumaresque, 
of Boston, He was altogether a different type

of man from the captain of the "Eureka" 
which brought me out in 1855. He was kind, 
intelligent and gentlemanly. When he found 
out who I was, he offered me a free passage 
from Hong Kong to Shanghai, He was, in 
fact, the sole owner of the vessel, which was 
named after his daughter, Florence. The pas- 
sage was a short one lasting only seven days 
but before it was over, we became great friends. 

Not long after my arrival in Shanghai, I 
found a situation in the Imperial Customs 
Translating Department, at a salary of Tls. 75 
a month, equivalent to $100 Mexican. For want 
of a Chinese silver currency the Mexican dollar 
was adopted. This was one point better than 
the interpretership in the Hong Kong Supreme 
Court. The duties were not arduous and trying. 
In fact, they were too simple and easy to suit 
my taste and ambition. I had plenty of time to 
read. Before three months of trial in my new 
situation, I found that things were not as they 
should be, and if I wished to keep a clean and 
clear record and an untarnished character, I 
could not remain long in the service. Between 
the interpreters who had been in the service many 
years and the Chinese shippers there existed a 
regular system of graft. After learning this,

and not wishing to be implicated with the others 
in the division of the spoils in any way or shape, 
I made up my mind to resign. So one day I 
called upon the Chief Commissioner of Customs, 
ostensibly to find out what my future prospects 
were in connection with the Customs Service 
whether or not there were any prospects of my 
being promoted to the position of a commis- 
sioner, I was told that no such prospects were 
held out to me or to any other Chinese interpre- 
ter. I, therefore, at once decided to throw up 
my position. So I sent in my resignation, which 
was at first not accepted. A few days after my 
first interview, Lay, the chief commissioner, 
strenuously tried to persuade me to change my 
mind, and offered as an inducement to raise my 
salary to Tls. 200 a month, evidently thinking 
that I was only bluffing in order to get higher 
wages. It did not occur to him that there was at 
least one Chinaman who valued a clean reputa- 
tion and an honest character more than money; 
that being an educated man, I saw no reason 
why I should not be given the same chances to 
rise in the service of the Chinese government as 
an Englishman, nor why my individuality should 
not be recognized and respected in every walk 
of life. He little thought that I had aspirations 



EFFORT TO FIND A POSITION 65 

even higher than his, and that I did not care 
to associate myself with a pack of Custom-house 
interpreters and inspectors, who were known to 
take bribes; that a man who expects others to 
respect him, must first respect himself. Such 
were my promptings, I did not state the real 
cause of my quitting the service, but at the 
end of four months' trial I left the service in 
order to try my fortune in new fields more 
congenial. 

My friends at the time looked upon me as a 
crank in throwing up a position yielding me 
Tls, 200 a month for something uncertain and 
untried. This in their estimation was the height 
of folly. They little realized what I was driving 
at. I had a clean record and I meant to keep it 
clean. I was perfectly aware that in less than 
a year since my return to China, I had made 
three shifts. I myself began to think I was 
too mercurial to accomplish anything substan- 
tial, or that I was too dreamy to be practical or 
too proud to succeed in life. But in a strenuous 
life one needs to be a dreamer in order to accom- 
plish possibilities. We are not called into being 
simply to drudge for an animal existence. I 
had had to work hard for my education, and I 
felt that I ought to make the most of what little 



66 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

I had, not so much to benefit myself individually 
as to make it a blessing common to my race. By 
these shifts and changes I was only trying to 
find my true bearing, and how I could make 
myself a blessing to China-
