CHAPTER XIV 

MY MISSION TO AMERICA TO BUY 
MACHINERY 

A week after my last interview with the Vice- 
roy and after I had been told that I was to be 
entrusted with the execution of the order, my 
commission was made out and issued to me. In 
addition to the commission, the fifth official rank 
was conferred on me. It was a nominal civil 
rank, with the privilege of wearing the blue 
feather, as was customary only in war time and 
limited to those connected with the military ser- 
vice, but discarded in the civil service, where the 
peacock's feather is conferred only by imperial 
sanction. Two official despatches were also made 
out, directing me where to receive the Tls. 
68,000, the entire amount for the purchase of 
the machinery* One-half of the amount was to 
be paid by the Taotai of Shanghai, and the other 
half by the Treasurer of Canton. After all the 
preliminary preparations had been completed, I 
bade farewell to the Viceroy and my Shanghai 
friends and started on my journey. 

On my arrival in Shanghai in October, 1863, 
I had the good fortune to meet Mr. John 
Haskins, an American mechanical engineer, who 
came out to China with machinery for Messrs. 
Russell & Co. He had finished his business with 
that firm and was expecting soon to return to the 
States with his family a wife and a little 
daughter. He was just the man I wanted. It 
did not take us long to get acquainted and as the 
time was short, we soon came to an understand- 
ing. We took the overland route from Hong 
Kong to London, via the Isthmus of Suez. 
Haskins and his family took passage on the 
French Messagerie Imperial line, while I 
engaged mine on board of one of the Peninsular 
& Oriental steamers. In my route to London, I 
touched at Singapore, crossed the Indian 
Ocean, and landed at Ceylon, where I changed 
steamers for Bengal up the Red Sea and landed 
at Cairo, where I had to cross the Isthmus by 
rail. The Suez Canal was not finished; the work 
of excavating was still going on. Arriving at 
Alexandria, I took passage from there to Mar- 
seilles, the southern port of France, while Has- 
kins and his family took a steamer direct for 
Southampton. From Marseilles I went to Paris 
by rail. I was there about ten days, long enough 
to give me a general idea of the city, its public 
buildings, churches, gardens, and of Parisian 
gaiety. I crossed the English channel from 
Calais to Dover and went thence by rail to 
London the first time in my life to touch English 
soil, and my first visit to the famous metrop- 
olis. While in London, I visited Whitworth's 
machine shop, and had the pleasure of renewing 
my acquaintance with Thomas Christy, whom I 
knew in China in the '50's. I was about a month 
in England, and then crossed the Atlantic in one 
of the Cunard steamers and landed in New York 
in the early spring of 1864, just ten years after 
my graduation from Yale and in ample time to 
be present at the decennial meeting of my 
class in July. Haskins and his family had pre- 
ceded me in another steamer for New York, in 
order that he might get to work on the drawings 
and specifications of the shop and machinery and 
get them completed as soon as possble. In 1864, 
the last year of the great Civil War, nearly all 
the machine shops in the country, especially in 
New England, were preoccupied and busy in 
executing government orders, and it was very 
difficult to have my machinery taken up. Finally 
Haskins succeeded in getting the Putnam 
Machine Co., Fitchburg, Mass., to fill the order. 

While Haskins was given sole charge of 
superintending the execution of the order, which 
required at least six months before the machinery 
could be completed for shipment to China, I took 
advantage of the interim to run down to New 
Haven and attend the decennial meeting of 
my class. It was to me a joyous event and I con- 
gratulated myself that I had the good luck to 
be present at our first re-union. Of course, the 
event that brought me back to the country was 
altogether unpretentious and had attracted little 
or no public attention at the time, because the 
whole country was completely engrossed in the 
last year of the great Civil War, yet I personally 
regarded my commission as an inevitable and 
preliminary step that would ultimately lead to 
the realization of my educational scheme, which 
had never for a moment escaped my mind. But 
at the meeting of my class, this subject of my 
life plan was not brought up. We had a 
most enjoyable time and parted with nearly the 
same fraternal feeling that characterized our 
parting at graduation. After the decennial 
meeting, I returned to Fitchburg and told Has- 
kins that I was going down to Washington to 
offer my services to the government as a volun- 
teer for the short period of six months, and that 
in case anything happened to me during the six 
months so that I could not come back to attend 
to the shipping of the machinery to Shanghai, 
he should attend to it. I left him all the 
papers the cost and description of the machin- 
ery, the bills of lading, insurance, and freight, 
and directed him to send everything to the 
Viceroy's agent in Shanghai. This precautionary 
step having been taken, I slipped down to Wash- 
ington. 

Brigadier-General Barnes of Springfield, 
Mass., happened to be the general in charge of 
the Volunteer Department. His headquarters 
were at Willard's Hotel. I called on him and 
made known to him my object, that I felt as a 
naturalized citizen of the United States, it was 
my bounden duty to offer my services as a 
volunteer courier to carry despatches between 
Washington and the nearest Federal camp for 
at least six months, simply to show my loyalty 
and patriotism to my adopted country, and that 
I would furnish my own equipments. He said 
that he remembered me well, having met me in 
the Yale Library in New Haven, in 1853, on a 
visit to his son, William Barnes, who was in the 
college at the time I was, and who afterwards 
became a prominent lawyer in San Francisco. 
General Barnes asked what business I was en- 
gaged in. I told him that since my graduation 
in 1854 I had been in China and had recently 
returned with an order to purchase machinery 
for a machine shop ordered by Viceroy and 
Generalissimo Tsang Kwoh Fan. I told him 
the machinery was being made to order in Fitch- 
burg, Mass., under the supervision of an 
American mechanical engineer, and as it would 
take at least six months before the same could 
be completed, I was anxious to offer my services 
to the government in the meantime as an evidence 
of my loyalty and patriotism to my adopted 
country. He was quite interested and pleased 
with what I said. 

"Well, my young friend," said he, "I thank 
you very much for your offer, but since you are 
charged with a responsible trust to execute for 
the Chinese government, you had better return 
to Fitchburg to attend to it. We have plenty of 
men to serve, both as couriers and as fighting 
men to go to the front." Against this peremptory 
decision, I could urge nothing further, but I felt 
that I had at least fulfilled my duty to my 
adopted country.

我前往美国购买机械的使命

在我最后一次觐见总督一周后，当我被正式告知将负责执行这项任务时，我的任命状随即被开具并交到我手中。除了任命状，我还被授予了第五品官阶。这是一个名义上的文职头衔，但让我获得了佩戴蓝翎的特权——这种待遇通常只在战争时期授予与军事事务有关的人员，而在文职体系中是被废除的。文官若要佩戴孔雀翎，必须获得皇帝的钦赐。另有两道公文发出，指示我分别向两地领取购置机械所需的总款银六万八千两：其中一半由上海道台支付，另一半由广东省财政厅支付。所有前期准备工作完成后，我便向总督及在上海的朋友辞行，踏上了旅途。

1863年10月我抵达上海，幸运地遇到了一位美国机械工程师约翰·哈斯金斯先生。他是随罗素洋行的机器设备来到中国的。那时他已完成与该公司的业务，正准备携带妻女回国。他正是我所需要的那种人。我们很快相识，鉴于时间紧迫，我们迅速达成一致。我们选择了经苏伊士地峡走陆路的路线从香港前往伦敦。哈斯金斯一家搭乘法国邮政轮船，而我则订了半岛与东方航运公司的船票。前往伦敦的途中，我先到达新加坡，横渡印度洋，抵达锡兰（今斯里兰卡），在那里换乘驶往孟加拉的轮船，穿越红海，登陆开罗，并乘火车穿过苏伊士地峡。当时苏伊士运河尚未完工，仍在开挖中。从亚历山大港，我乘船前往法国南部港口马赛，而哈斯金斯一家则直接乘船前往南安普顿。我从马赛乘火车抵达巴黎，在巴黎逗留了约十天，对这座城市的公共建筑、教堂、花园及巴黎人的热情奔放有了一个大致的印象。我从加来横渡英吉利海峡抵达多佛，再转乘火车前往伦敦——这是我人生第一次踏上英国的土地，也是第一次造访这座著名的首都。在伦敦期间，我参观了惠特沃斯的机器厂，并很高兴地重新见到了托马斯·克里斯蒂——我在1850年代于中国相识的朋友。我在英国逗留了大约一个月，随后乘坐卡纳德公司的轮船横渡大西洋，在1864年初春抵达纽约。那时正好是我从耶鲁大学毕业十周年的时间，我赶上了那年七月的同学十年聚会。哈斯金斯一家比我早一步抵达纽约，他需要提前着手绘制工厂及机械设备的图纸和规格说明，以便尽快完成。1864年是美国内战的最后一年，全国几乎所有的机器厂，尤其是新英格兰地区的工厂，都忙于执行政府订单，因此要让他们接下我们的机械订单是非常困难的。最终，哈斯金斯成功说服了马萨诸塞州菲奇堡的普特南机械公司接受了订单。

在哈斯金斯全权负责监督制造机械的事务之时，这项工作至少需要六个月时间才能完成，我便利用这段空档前往纽黑文，参加我们班级的十年聚会。那是一段令人欣喜的时光，我为自己能参加首次校友重聚感到十分庆幸。当然，这次让我回国的任务本身是低调而不引人注目的，当时也没有引起公众注意，因为整个国家都沉浸在内战的最后阶段。但我个人却始终把这次受命看作是实现我教育理想的一个必经且关键的起点，这个理想从未在我脑中稍离。但在同学聚会上，我并未提及我的人生计划。我们聚会其乐融融，重聚之情几如当年毕业时那般兄弟情谊深厚。聚会结束后，我回到菲奇堡，并告诉哈斯金斯我打算前往华盛顿，向政府自愿提供六个月的志愿服务，并叮嘱他万一我在这期间遭遇不测无法回来办理机械运送事宜，他应代为处理。我将所有资料交给他——包括机械的费用与详细说明、提单、保险单、运费等，并嘱咐他将所有物品发送至总督驻上海的代理人手中。安排妥当之后，我便前往华盛顿。

马萨诸塞州斯普林菲尔德的巴恩斯准将当时正负责志愿兵事务，驻地在威拉德酒店。我拜访了他，说明来意，表示自己作为归化美国公民，认为有责任在此关键时刻自愿服务政府，担任在华盛顿与最近的联邦军营之间传送文件的信使，为期六个月，以表达我对祖国的忠诚与爱国情怀，并愿意自备所需装备。他说他还记得我，曾于1853年在纽黑文耶鲁图书馆见过我，当时他去看望他的儿子威廉·巴恩斯——他正是我同届的同学，后来成为旧金山一位著名律师。巴恩斯将军问我目前从事什么工作，我告诉他，自1854年毕业后我便一直在中国，最近因受命负责为曾国藩总督兼统帅订购机械设备而返回美国。我说这批机器正由一位美国机械工程师在马萨诸塞州菲奇堡督造，至少还需六个月时间才能完成，因此我愿意在此期间为政府效力，以示我对所归属国家的忠诚与热爱。他对我说的话十分感兴趣，也很高兴。

“好吧，我的年轻朋友，”他说，“我非常感谢你的提议，但既然你肩负着中国政府委托的重要任务，你最好还是回到菲奇堡去负责完成它。我们这边的信使和士兵并不缺人。”对他这番断然的回复，我已无法多说什么，但我感到，至少我已经尽了自己对这个国家应尽的责任。

第十四章
赴美采购机器之使命

在与总督最后一次会面并得知将委我以执行此令的重任后，一周之内，我的委任状便签发下来。除委任状外，更授予我五品官衔。此乃虚衔文职，却破例获准佩戴蓝翎——此等殊荣通常仅战时授予军职人员，文官体系向以孔雀翎为尊，非经御赐不可得。另备有两道公文，指明我领取六万八千两银款的去处，此系采购机器的全部款项*。半数由上海道台支付，余下则由广东藩库拨付。待诸事筹备停当，我即辞别总督及沪上友人，启程赴任。

1863年10月抵沪时，幸遇美国机械工程师约翰·哈斯金斯先生。他刚为旗昌洋行运送机器来华，正拟携妻女返美。此君正是我苦寻之人。我们一见如故，时不我待，旋即达成共识。取道香港经苏伊士地峡陆路赴伦敦时，哈斯金斯一家搭乘法国邮船公司航线，我则选乘半岛东方轮船公司蒸汽船。途经新加坡横渡印度洋，于锡兰换乘驶往孟加拉的蒸汽船，溯红海北上至开罗，转乘火车穿越地峡——当时苏伊士运河尚未竣工，开凿工程仍在进行。抵亚历山大港后，我改赴法国南港马赛，哈斯金斯一家则直航南安普敦。从马赛乘火车至巴黎，盘桓旬日，得以遍览都城风貌：宫阙教堂、园林胜景，兼领略巴黎式欢愉。由加莱渡英吉利海峡至多佛，再乘火车抵伦敦——此生初踏英伦，首访名都。在伦敦参观惠特沃斯机器厂时，幸与旧识托马斯·克里斯蒂重逢，此人乃五十年代在华故交。驻英约一月后，乘冠达邮轮横渡大西洋，于1864年初春抵纽约，恰距耶鲁毕业整十载，正好赶及七月同窗会。哈斯金斯已携眷先期抵美，着手绘制厂房图纸与机器规格说明书，以期尽快完工。

时值1864年南北战争末期，新英格兰地区机器厂皆忙于政府订单，我的采购计划屡屡受挫。最终哈斯金斯说动马萨诸塞州菲奇堡的普特南机器公司接下订单。趁哈斯金斯全权督造机器之便——此工程至少需半年方能完工装船——我抽身赴纽黑文参加毕业十周年聚会。此乃人生快事，自庆得逢首次同窗重聚。虽当时举国瞩目内战终局，我此行使命未引公众关注，然我视此为推进教育大业之关键一步，此志未尝一日忘怀。然同窗会上未提及此生宏愿，众人尽欢而散，依依之情不减当年毕业别离。会后返菲奇堡告知哈斯金斯：我欲赴华盛顿以志愿者身份报效政府六月，若此期间有不测致无法押运机器返沪，一切托付于他。我将机器价目明细、提单保单等文书悉数交予，嘱其发往上海总督衙门代理人处。诸事安排妥当，便悄然赴京。

恰逢马萨诸塞州斯普林菲尔德巴恩斯准将主理志愿军事务，其指挥部设于威拉德酒店。谒见时我陈情道：身为归化美国公民，愿自备鞍马，充任华盛顿至最近联邦军营的传令兵六月，以表忠忱。将军忆及1853年访耶鲁图书馆时曾有一面之缘——其子威廉·巴恩斯与吾同期入学，后成旧金山名律师。询及近况，我具告奉曾国藩总督之命采购机器事，并言："眼下机器正在菲奇堡定制，工期至少半年，故欲借此间隙报效国家"。将军闻言动容。

"青年友朋，"他终道，"此心可感。然既受中国政府重托，宜返菲奇堡尽职。我邦不缺传令与作战之士。"见此决断，我不复多言，然自忖已尽归化公民之责。
