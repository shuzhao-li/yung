CHAPTER XIV 

MY MISSION TO AMERICA TO BUY 
MACHINERY 

A week after my last interview with the Vice- 
roy and after I had been told that I was to be 
entrusted with the execution of the order, my 
commission was made out and issued to me. In 
addition to the commission, the fifth official rank 
was conferred on me. It was a nominal civil 
rank, with the privilege of wearing the blue 
feather, as was customary only in war time and 
limited to those connected with the military ser- 
vice, but discarded in the civil service, where the 
peacock's feather is conferred only by imperial 
sanction. Two official despatches were also made 
out, directing me where to receive the Tls. 
68,000, the entire amount for the purchase of 
the machinery* One-half of the amount was to 
be paid by the Taotai of Shanghai, and the other 
half by the Treasurer of Canton. After all the 
preliminary preparations had been completed, I 
bade farewell to the Viceroy and my Shanghai 

friends and started on my journey.

MY MISSION TO BUY MACHINERY 155 

On my arrival in Shanghai in October, 1863, 
I had the good fortune to meet Mr. John 
Haskins, an American mechanical engineer, who 
came out to China with machinery for Messrs. 
Russell & Co. He had finished his business with 
that firm and was expecting soon to return to the 
States with his family a wife and a little 
daughter. He was just the man I wanted. It 
did not take us long to get acquainted and as the 
time was short, we soon came to an understand- 
ing. We took the overland route from Hong 
Kong to London, via the Isthmus of Suez. 
Haskins and his family took passage on the 
French Messagerie Imperial line, while I 
engaged mine on board of one of the Peninsular 
& Oriental steamers. In my route to London, I 
touched at Singapore, crossed the Indian 
Ocean, and landed at Ceylon, where I changed 
steamers for Bengal up the Red Sea and landed 
at Cairo, where I had to cross the Isthmus by 
rail. The Suez Canal was not finished; the work 
of excavating was still going on. Arriving at 
Alexandria, I took passage from there to Mar- 
seilles, the southern port of France, while Has- 
kins and his family took a steamer direct for 
Southampton. From Marseilles I went to Paris 
by rail. I was there about ten days, long enough 



156 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

to give me a general idea of the city, its public 
buildings, churches, gardens, and of Parisian 
gaiety. I crossed the English channel from 
Calais to Dover and went thence by rail to 
London the first time in my life to touch Eng- 
lish soil, and my first visit to the famous metrop- 
olis. While in London, I visited Whitworth's 
machine shop, and had the pleasure of renewing 
my acquaintance with Thomas Christy, whom I 
knew in China in the *50's* I was about a month 
in England, and then crossed the Atlantic in one 
of the Cunard steamers and landed in New York 
in the early spring of 1864, just ten years after 
my graduation from Yale and in ample time to 
be present at the decennial meeting of my 
class in July. Haskins and his family had pre- 
ceded me in another steamer for New York, in 
order that he might get to work on the drawings 
and specifications of the shop and machinery and 
get them completed as soon as possble. In 1864, 
the last year of the great Civil War, nearly all 
the machine shops in the country, especially in 
New England, were preoccupied and busy in 
executing government orders, and it was very 
difficult to have my machinery taken up. Finally 
Haskins succeeded in getting the Putnam 
Machine Co., Fitchburg, Mass., to fill the order. 



MY MISSION TO BUY MACHINERY 157 

While Haskins was given sole charge of 
superintending the execution of the order, which 
required at least six months before the machinery 
could be completed for shipment to China, I took 
advantage of the interim to run down to New 
Haven and attend the decennial meeting of 
my class. It was to me a joyous event and I con- 
gratulated myself that I had the good luck to 
be present at our first re-union. Of course, the 
event that brought me back to the country was 
altogether unpretentious and had attracted little 
or no public attention at the time, because the 
whole country was completely engrossed in the 
last year of the great Civil War, yet I personally 
regarded my commission as an inevitable and 
preliminary step that would ultimately lead to 
the realization of my educational scheme, which 
had never for a moment escaped my mind. But 
at the meeting of my class, this subject of my 
life plan was not brought up. We had a 
most enjoyable time and parted with nearly the 
same fraternal feeling that characterized our 
parting at graduation. After the decennial 
meeting, I returned to Fitchburg and told Has- 
kins that I was going down to Washington to 
offer my services to the government as a volun- 
teer for the short period of six months, and that 



158 MY LIFE IN CHINA AND AMERICA 

in case anything happened to me during the six 
months so that I could not come back to attend 
to the shipping of the machinery to Shanghai, 
he should attend to it. I left him all the 
papers the cost and description of the machin- 
ery, the bills of lading, insurance, and freight, 
and directed him to send everything to the 
Viceroy's agent in Shanghai. This precautionary 
step having been taken, I slipped down to Wash- 
ington. 

Brigadier-General Barnes of Springfield, 
Mass., happened to be the general in charge of 
the Volunteer Department. His headquarters 
were at Willard's Hotel. I called on him and 
made known to him my object, that I felt as a 
naturalized citizen of the United States, it was 
my bounden duty to offer my services as a 
volunteer courier to carry despatches between 
Washington and the nearest Federal camp for 
at least six months, simply to show my loyalty 
and patriotism to my adopted country, and that 
I would furnish my own equipments. He said 
that he remembered me well, having met me in 
the Yale Library in New Haven, in 1853, on a 
visit to his son, William Barnes, who was in the 
college at the time I was, and who afterwards 
became a prominent lawyer in San Francisco. 



MY MISSION TO BUY MACHINERY 159 

General Barnes asked what business I was en- 
gaged in. I told him that since my graduation 
in 1854 I had been in China and had recently 
returned with an order to purchase machinery 
for a machine shop ordered by Viceroy and 
Generalissimo Tsang Kwoh Fan. I told him 
the machinery was being made to order in Fitch- 
burg, Mass., under the supervision of an 
American mechanical engineer, and as it would 
take at least six months before the same could 
be completed, I was anxious to offer my services 
to the government in the meantime as an evidence 
of my loyalty and patriotism to my adopted 
country. He was quite interested and pleased 
with what I said. 

"Well, my young friend," said he, "I thank 
you very much for your offer, but since you are 
charged with a responsible trust to execute for 
the Chinese government, you had better return 
to Fitchburg to attend to it. We have plenty of 
men to serve, both as couriers and as fighting 
men to go to the front." Against this peremptory 
decision, I could urge nothing further, but I felt 
that I had at least fulfilled my duty to my 
adopted country.
