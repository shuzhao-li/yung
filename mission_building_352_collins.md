The building was at 352 Collins Street in Hartford, CT.

According to Sterner, the building was torn down in 1967 to make room for new buildings of the hospital. 

A map from 1896 atlas of hartford was shown, where 352 Collins St bore the name of Edward W. Kellogg, brother-in-law of Yung Wing, I believe.

St. Thomas Seminary purchased the building in 1897 before the seminary moved to Bloomfield, CT in 1930:
